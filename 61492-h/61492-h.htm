  <h2 id='b3' class='c004'>BOOK III.<br /> <br />FROM ULIETEA TO NEW ZEALAND.</h2>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='b3c1' class='c004'>CHAP. I.<br /> <br />PASSAGE FROM ULIETEA TO THE FRIENDLY ISLES; WITH A DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL ISLANDS THAT WERE DISCOVERED, AND THE INCIDENTS WHICH HAPPENED IN THAT TRACK. </h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>On the 6th, being the day after leaving Ulietea, at
eleven o’clock A.&nbsp;M. we saw land bearing N.&nbsp;W.,
which, upon a nearer approach, we found to be a low
reef island about four leagues in compass, and of a
circular form. It is composed of several small patches
connected together by breakers, the largest lying on
the N.&nbsp;E. part. This is Howe island, discovered by
Captain Wallis, who, I think, sent his boat to examine
it; and, if I have not been misinformed, found a
channel through, within the reef, near the N.&nbsp;W. part.
The inhabitants of Ulietea speak of an uninhabited
island, about this situation, called by them Mopeha,
to which they go at certain seasons for turtle. Perhaps
this may be the same; as we saw no signs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>inhabitants upon it. Its latitude is 16° 46ʹ South;
longitude 154° 8ʹ West.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this day to the 16th, we met with nothing
remarkable, and our course was West southerly; the
winds variable from the North round by the East to
S.&nbsp;W. attended with cloudy, rainy, unsettled weather,
and a southerly swell. We generally brought to, or
stood upon a wind, during night; and in the day
made all the sail we could. About half an hour after
sun-rise this morning, land was seen from the top-mast
head, bearing N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. We immediately altered
the course and steering for it, found it to be another
reef island, composed of five or six woody islets,
connected together by sand banks and breakers, inclosing
a lake, into which we could see no entrance.
We ranged the West and N.&nbsp;W. coasts, from its
southern to its northern extremity, which is about
two leagues; and so near the shore, that at one time
we could see the rocks under us; yet we found no
anchorage, nor saw we any signs of inhabitants.
There were plenty of various kinds of birds, and the
coast seemed to abound with fish. The situation of
this isle is not very distant from that assigned by
Mr. Dalrymple for La Sagitaria, discovered by Quiros;
but, by the description the discoverer has given of it,
it cannot be the same. For this reason, I looked
upon it as a new discovery, and named it Palmerston
Island, in honour of Lord Palmerston, one of the
Lords of the Admiralty. It is situated in latitude
18° 4ʹ South, longitude 163° 10ʹ West.</p>

<p class='c000'>At four o’clock in the afternoon we left this isle,
and resumed our course to the W. by S. with a fine
steady gale easterly, till noon on the 20th, at which
time, being in latitude 18° 50ʹ, longitude 168° 52ʹ,
we thought we saw land to S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. and hauled up
for it accordingly. But two hours after, we discovered
our mistake, and resumed our course W. by S.
Soon after we saw land from the mast-head in the
same direction; and, as we drew nearer, found it to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>be an island which, at five o’clock, bore West, distant
five leagues. Here we spent the night plying under
the top-sails; and, at day-break next morning, bore
away, steering for the northern point, and ranging
the West coast at the distance of one mile, till near
noon. Then, perceiving some people on the shore,
and landing seeming to be easy, we brought to, and
hoisted out two boats, with which I put off to the land,
accompanied by some of the officers and gentlemen.
As we drew near the shore, some of the inhabitants,
who were on the rocks, retired to the woods, to meet
us, as we supposed; and we afterwards found our
conjectures right. We landed with ease in a small
creek, and took post on a high rock to prevent a surprise.
Here we displayed our colours, and Mr.
Forster and his party began to collect plants, &amp;c.
The coast was so over-run with woods, bushes, plants,
stones, &amp;c. that we could not see forty yards round
us. I took two men, and with them entered a kind
of chasm, which opened a way into the woods. We
had not gone far before we heard the natives approaching;
upon which I called to Mr. Forster to retire to
the party, as I did likewise. We had no sooner
joined, than the islanders appeared at the entrance of
a chasm not a stone’s-throw from us. We began to
speak, and make all the friendly signs we could think
of to them, which they answered by menaces; and
one of two men, who were advanced before the rest,
threw a stone, which struck Mr. Sparrman on the
arm. Upon this two musquets were fired, without
order, which made them all retire under cover of the
woods; and we saw them no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>After waiting some little time, and till we were
satisfied nothing was to be done here, the country
being so over-run with bushes, that it was hardly
possible to come to parly with them, we embarked
and proceeded down along shore, in hopes of meeting
with better success in another place. After ranging
the coast for some miles without seeing a living soul,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>or any convenient landing-place, we at length came
before a small beach, on which lay four canoes.
Here we landed by means of a little creek, formed by
the flat rocks before it, with a view of just looking at
the canoes, and to leave some medals, nails, &amp;c. in
them; for not a soul was to be seen. The situation
of this place was to us worse than the former. A
flat rock lay next the sea; behind it a narrow stone
<a id='beach'></a>beach; this was bounded by a perpendicular rocky
cliff of unequal height, whose top was covered with
shrubs; two deep and narrow chasms in the cliff
seemed to open a communication into the country.
In, or before one of these, lay the four canoes which
we were going to look at; but in the doing of this, I
saw we should be exposed to an attack from the
natives, if there were any, without being in a situation
proper for defence. To prevent this, as much as
could be, and to secure a retreat in case of an attack,
I ordered the men to be drawn up upon the rock,
from whence they had a view of the heights; and
only myself, and four of the gentlemen, went up to
the canoes. We had been there but a few minutes,
before the natives, I cannot say how many, rushed
down the chasm out of the wood upon us. The endeavours
we used to bring them to a parly, were to
no purpose; for they came with the ferocity of wild
boars, and threw their darts. Two or three musquets,
<a id='dis'></a>discharged in the air, did not hinder one of them
from advancing still farther, and throwing another
dart, or rather a spear, which passed close over my
shoulder. His courage would have cost him his life,
had not my musquet missed fire; for I was not five
paces from him, when he threw his spear, and had
resolved to shoot him to save myself. I was glad
afterwards that it happened as it did. At this instant,
our men on the rock began to fire at others who appeared
on the heights, which abated the ardour of the
party we were engaged with, and gave us time to
join our people, when I caused the firing to cease.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>The last discharge sent all the islanders to the woods,
from whence they did not return so long as we remained.
We did not know that any were hurt. It
was remarkable, that when I joined our party, I tried
my musquet in the air, and it went off as well as a
piece could do. Seeing no good was to be got with
these people, or at the isle, as having no port, we returned
on board, and having hoisted in the boats,
made sail to W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. I had forgot to mention, in
its proper order, that having put ashore a little before
we came to this last place, three or four of us went
upon the cliffs, where we found the country, as before,
nothing but coral rocks, all over-run with bushes; so
that it was hardly possible to penetrate into it, and
we embarked again with intent to return directly on
board, till we saw the canoes; being directed to the
place by the opinion of some of us, who thought they
heard some people.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conduct and aspect of these islanders occasioned
my naming it Savage Island. It is situated
in the latitude 19° 1ʹ South, longitude 169° 37ʹ West.
It is about eleven leagues in circuit; of a round form,
and good height; and hath deep waters close to its
shores. All the sea-coast, and as far inland as we
could see, is wholly covered with trees, shrubs, &amp;c.
amongst which were some cocoa-nut trees; but what
the interior parts may produce, we know not. To
judge of the whole garment by the skirts, it cannot
produce much; for so much as we saw of it consisted
wholly of coral rocks, all over-run with wood
and bushes. Not a bit of soil was to be seen; the
rocks alone supplying the trees with humidity. If
these coral rocks were first formed in the sea by
animals, how came they thrown up to such a height?
Has this island been raised by an earthquake? Or has
the sea receded from it? Some philosophers have attempted
to account for the formation of low isles,
such as are in this sea; but I do not know that any
thing has been said of high islands, or such as I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>been speaking of. In this island, not only the loose
rocks which cover the surface, but the cliffs which
bound the shores, are of coral stone, which the continual
beating of the sea has formed into a variety of
curious caverns, some of them very large: the roof or
rock over them being supported by pillars, which the
foaming waves have formed into a multitude of shapes,
and made more curious than the caverns themselves.
In one, we saw light was admitted through a hole at
the top; in another place, we observed that the whole
roof of one of these caverns had sunk in, and formed
a kind of valley above, which lay considerably below
the circumjacent rocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>I can say but little of the inhabitants, who I believe,
are not numerous. They seemed to be stout,
well-made men, were naked, except round the waists,
and some of them had their faces, breast, and thighs
painted black. The canoes were precisely like those
of Amsterdam; with the addition of a little rising
like a gunwale on each side of the open part; and
had some carving about them, which shewed that
these people are full as ingenious. Both these islanders
and their canoes, agree very well with the descriptions
M. de Bougainville has given of those he
saw off the Isle of Navigators, which lies nearly under
the same meridian.</p>

<p class='c000'>After leaving Savage Island, we continued to steer
W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. with a fine easterly trade-wind, till the 24th
in the evening, when, judging ourselves not far from
Rotterdam, we brought to, and spent the night plying
under the top-sails. At day-break, next morning,
we bore away West; and, soon after, saw a
string of islands extending from S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. by the West
to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. The wind being at N.&nbsp;E. we hauled to
N.&nbsp;W. with a view of discovering more distinctly the
isles in that quarter; but, presently after, we discovered
a reef of rocks a-head, extending on each bow
farther than we could see. As we could not weather
them, it became necessary to tack and bear up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the South, to look for a passage that way. At noon,
the southernmost island bore S.&nbsp;W.; distant four miles.
North of this isle were three others, all connected
by breakers, which we were not sure did not join to
those we had seen in the morning, as some were observed
in the intermediate space. Some islands were
also seen to the West of those four; but Rotterdam
was not yet in sight. Latitude 20° 23ʹ S. longitude
174° 6ʹ West. During the whole afternoon, we had
little wind: so that, at sunset, the southernmost isle
bore W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W., distant five miles; and some breakers,
we had seen to the South, bore now S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. half
W. Soon after it fell calm, and we were left to the
mercy of a great easterly swell; which, however,
happened to have no great effect upon the ship. The
calm continued till four o’clock the next morning,
when it was succeeded by a breeze from the South.
At day-light, perceiving a likelihood of a passage
between the islands to the North, and the breakers to
the South, we stretched in West, and soon after saw
more islands, both to the S.&nbsp;W. and N.&nbsp;W. but the
passage seemed open and clear. Upon drawing near
the islands, we sounded, and found forty-five and
forty fathoms, a clear sandy bottom. I was now
quite easy, since it was in our power to anchor, in
case of a calm; or to spend the night, if we found
no passage. Towards noon, some canoes came off
to us from one of the isles, having two or three people
in each; who advanced boldly along-side, and
exchanged some cocoa-nuts, and shaddocks for small
nails. They pointed out to us Anamocka or Rotterdam;
an advantage we derived from knowing the
proper names. They likewise gave us the names of
some of the other isles, and invited us much to go
to theirs, which they called Cornango. The breeze
freshening, we left them astern, and steered for Anamocka;
meeting with a clear passage, in which we
found unequal sounding, from forty to nine fathoms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>depending, I believe, in a great measure, on our
distance from the islands which form it.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we drew near the south end of Rotterdam, or
Anamocka, we were met by a number of canoes,
laden with fruit and roots; but, as I did not shorten
sail, we had but little traffic with them. The people
in one canoe enquired for me by name; a proof that
these people have an intercourse with those of Amsterdam.
They importuned us much to go towards
their coast, letting us know, as we understood them,
that we might anchor there. This was on the S.&nbsp;W.
side of the island, where the coast seemed to be sheltered
from the South and S.&nbsp;E. winds; but as the day
was far spent, I could not attempt to go in there, as
it would have been necessary to have sent first a boat
in to examine it. I therefore stood for the north side
of the island, where we anchored about three-fourths
of a mile from shore; the extremes of it bearing S.
88° East to S.&nbsp;W. a cove with a sandy beach at the
bottom of it S. 50° East.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>Before we had well got to an anchor, the natives
came off from all parts in canoes, bringing with
them yams and shaddocks, which they exchanged
for small nails and old rags. One man taking a vast
liking to our lead and line, got hold of it, and, in
spite of all the threats I could make use of, cut the
line with a stone; but a discharge of small shot made
him return it. Early in the morning, I went ashore,
with Mr. Gilbert, to look for fresh water. We landed
in the cove above-mentioned, and were received with
great courtesy by the natives. After I had distributed
some presents amongst them, I asked for water, and
was conducted to a pond of it that was brackish, about
three-fourths of a mile from the landing-place; which
I suppose to be the same that Tasman watered at. In
the mean time, the people in the boat had laden her
with fruit and roots, which the natives had brought
down, and exchanged for nails and beads. On our
return to the ship, I found the same sort of traffic
carrying on there. After breakfast, I went ashore
with two boats to trade with the people, accompanied
by several of the gentlemen, and ordered the launch
to follow with casks to be filled with water. The natives
assisted us to roll them to and from the pond;
and a nail or a bead was the expence of their labour.
Fruit and roots, especially shaddocks and yams, were
brought down in such plenty, that the two boats were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>laden, sent off, cleared, and laden a second time, before
noon; by which time also the launch had got a
full supply of water, and the botanical and shooting
parties had all come in, except the surgeon, for whom
we could not wait, as the tide was ebbing fast out of
the cove; consequently he was left behind. As there
is no getting into the cove with a boat, from between
half ebb to half flood, we could get off no water in
the afternoon. However, there is a very good landing-place
without it, near the southern point, where
boats can get ashore at all times of the tide; here
some of the officers landed after dinner, where they
found the surgeon, who had been robbed of his gun.
Having come down to the shore some time after the
boats had put off, he got a canoe to bring him on
board; but as he was getting into her, a fellow
snatched hold of the gun, and ran off with it. After
that no one would carry him to the ship, and they
would have stripped him, as he imagined, had he not
presented a tooth-pick case, which they, no doubt,
thought was a little gun. As soon as I heard of this,
I landed at the place above-mentioned, and the few
natives who were there fled at my approach. After
landing, I went in search of the officers, whom I found
in the cove, where we had been in the morning, with a
good many of the natives about them. No step had
been taken to recover the gun, nor did I think proper
to take any; but in this I was wrong. The easy
manner of obtaining this gun, which they now, no
doubt, thought secure in their possession, encouraged
them to proceed in these tricks, as will soon appear.
The alarm the natives had caught being soon over,
they carried fruit, &amp;c. to the boats, which got pretty
well laden before night, when we all returned on
board.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the morning of the 28th, Lieutenant
Clerke, with the Master and fourteen or fifteen men,
went on shore in the launch for water. I did intend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>to have followed in another boat myself, but rather
unluckily deferred it till after breakfast. The launch
was no sooner landed than the natives gathered about
her, behaving in so rude a manner, that the officers
were in some doubt if they should land the casks;
but, as they expected me on shore soon, they ventured,
and, with difficulty, got them filled, and into
the boat again. In the doing of this, Mr. Clerke’s
gun was snatched from him, and carried off; as were
also some of the cooper’s tools; and several of the
people were stripped of one thing or another. All
this was done, as it were, by stealth; for they laid
hold of nothing by main force. I landed just as the
launch was ready to put off; and the natives, who
were pretty numerous on the beach, as soon as they
saw me, fled; so that I suspected something had happened.
However, I prevailed on many to stay, and
Mr. Clerke came, and informed me of all the preceding
circumstances. I quickly came to a resolution
to oblige them to make restitution; and, for this purpose,
ordered all the marines to be armed, and sent
on shore. Mr. Forster and his party being gone into
the country, I ordered two or three guns to be fired
from the ship, in order to alarm him; not knowing
how the natives might act on this occasion. These
orders being given, I sent all the boats off but one,
with which I stayed, having a good many of the
natives about me, who behaved with their usual courtesy.
I made them so sensible of my intention, that
long before the marines came, Mr. Clerke’s musquet
was brought, but they used many excuses to divert
me from insisting on the other. At length Mr. Edgecumbe
arriving with the marines, this alarmed them
so much, that some of them fled. The first step I
took was to seize on two large double-sailing canoes,
which were in the cove. One fellow making resistance,
I fired some small shot at him, and sent him
limping off. The natives being now convinced that
I was in earnest, all fled; but on my calling to them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>many returned; and, presently after, the other musquet
was brought, and laid at my feet. That moment
I ordered the canoes to be restored, to show them on
what account they were detained. The other things
we had lost being of less value, I was the more indifferent
about them. By this time the launch was
ashore for another turn of water, and we were permitted
to fill the casks without any one daring to come
near us; except one man, who had befriended us
during the whole affair, and seemed to disapprove of
the conduct of his countrymen.</p>

<p class='c000'>On my returning from the pond to the cove, I
found a good many people collected together, from
whom we understood that the man I had fired at was
dead. This story I treated as improbable, and addressed
a man, who seemed of some consequence,
for the restitution of a cooper’s adze we had lost in
the morning. He immediately sent away two men,
as I thought, for it; but I soon found that we had
greatly mistaken each other; for, instead of the adze,
they brought the wounded man, stretched out on a
board, and laid him down by me, to all appearance dead.
I was much moved at the sight; but soon saw my
mistake, and that he was only wounded in the hand
and thigh. I therefore desired he might be carried
out of the sun, and sent for the surgeon to dress his
wounds. In the mean time, I addressed several people
for the adze; for as I had now nothing else to do, I
determined to have it. The one I applied the most to,
was an elderly woman, who had always a great deal
to say to me, from my first landing; but, on this occasion,
she gave her tongue full scope. I understood
but little of her eloquence; and all I could gather
from her arguments was, that it was mean in me to
insist on the return of so trifling a thing. But when
she found I was determined, she and three or four
more women went away; and soon after the adze
was brought me, but I saw her no more. This I was
sorry for, as I wanted to make her a present, in return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>for the part she had taken in all our transactions,
private as well as public. For I was no sooner returned
from the pond, the first time I landed, than
this old lady presented to me a girl, giving me to understand
she was at my service. Miss, who probably
had received her instructions, wanted, as a preliminary
article, a spike-nail, or a shirt, neither of which
I had to give her, and soon made them sensible of my
poverty. I thought, by that means, to have come off
with flying colours; but I was mistaken; for they gave
me to understand I might retire with her on credit. On
my declining this proposal, the old lady began to argue
with me; and then abuse me. Though I comprehended
little of what she said, her actions were expressive
enough, and showed that her words were to
this effect, sneering in my face, saying, what sort of a
man are you, thus to refuse the embraces of so fine a
young woman? For the girl certainly did not want
beauty; which, however, I could better withstand,
than the abuses of this worthy matron, and therefore
hastened into the boat. They wanted me to take the
young lady aboard; but this could not be done, as I
had given strict orders, before I went ashore, to suffer
no woman, on any pretence whatever, to come into
the ship, for reasons which I shall mention in another
place.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the surgeon got ashore, he dressed the
man’s wounds, and bled him; and was of opinion that
he was in no sort of danger, as the shot had done little
more than penetrate the skin. In the operation, some
poultice being wanting, the surgeon asked for ripe
plantains; but they brought sugar-cane, and having
chewed it to a pulp, gave it him to apply to the wound.
This being of a more balsamic nature than the other,
proves that these people have some knowledge of
simples. As soon as the man’s wounds were dressed,
I made him a present, which his master, or at least
the man who owned the canoe, took most probably
to himself. Matters being thus settled, apparently <a id='to3'></a>to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the satisfaction of all parties, we repaired on board
to dinner, where I found a good supply of fruit and
roots, and therefore gave orders to get every thing in
readiness to sail.</p>

<p class='c000'>I now was informed of a circumstance which was
observed on board: several canoes being at the ship,
when the great guns were fired in the morning, they
all retired, but one man, who was bailing the water
out of his canoe, which lay along-side, directly under
the guns. When the first was fired, he just looked
up, and then, quite unconcerned, continued his work;
nor had the second gun any other effect upon him;
he did not stir till the water was all out of his canoe,
when he paddled leisurely off. This man had several
times been observed to take fruit and roots out of
other canoes, and sell them to us. If the owners did
not willingly part with them, he took them by force;
by which he obtained the appellation of custom-house
officer. One time, after he had been collecting tribute,
he happened to be lying along-side of a sailing
canoe which was on board. One of her people seeing
him look another way, and his attention otherwise
engaged, took the opportunity of stealing somewhat
out of his canoe; they then put off, and set their
sail; but the man, perceiving the trick they had
played him, darted after them, and having soon got
on board their canoe, beat him who had taken his
things, and not only brought back his own but many
other articles which he took from them. This man
had likewise been observed making collections on
shore at the trading-place. I remembered to have
seen him there; and, on account of his gathering
tribute, took him to be a man of consequence, and
was going to make him a present; but some of their
people would not let me; saying he was no <i>Areeke</i>,
(that is, chief). He had his hair always powdered
with some kind of white dust.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we had no wind to sail this afternoon, a party
of us went ashore in the evening. We found the natives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>every where courteous and obliging; so that, had
we made a longer stay, it is probable we should have
had no more reason to complain of their conduct.
While I was now on shore, I got the names of twenty
islands which lie between the N.&nbsp;W. and N.&nbsp;E. some
of them in sight. Two of them, which lie most to
the West, viz. Amattafoa and Oghao, are remarkable
on account of their great height. In Amattafoa, which
is the westernmost, we judged there was a volcano, by
the continual column of smoke we saw daily ascending
from the middle of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both Mr. Cooper and myself being on shore at
noon, Mr. Wales could not wind up the watch at the
usual time; and, as we did not come on board till late
in the afternoon, it was forgotten till it was down.
This circumstance was of no consequence, as Mr.
Wales had had several altitudes of the sun at this
place, before it went down; and also had opportunities
of taking some after.</p>

<p class='c000'>At day-break on the 29th, having got under sail
with a light breeze at West, we stood to the North
for the two high islands; but the wind, scanting upon
us, carried us in amongst the low isles and shoals; so
that we had to ply to clear them. This gave time
for a great many canoes, from all parts, to get up
with us. The people in them brought for traffic various
articles; some roots, fruits and fowls, but of the
latter not many. They took in exchange small nails,
and pieces of any kinds of cloth. I believe, before
they went away, they stripped the most of our people
of the few clothes the ladies of Otaheite had left them;
for the passion for curiosities was as great as ever.
Having got clear of the low isles, we made a stretch to
the South, and did but fetch a little to windward of
the south end of Anamocka; so that we got little by
this day’s plying. Here we spent the night, making
short boards over that space with which we made ourselves
acquainted the preceding day.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 30th at day-break stretched out for Amattafoa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>with a gentle breeze at W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. Day no sooner
dawned than we saw canoes coming from all parts.
Their traffic was much the same as it had been the
day before, or rather better; for out of one canoe I
got two pigs, which were scarce articles here. At
four in the afternoon, we drew near the island of
Amattafoa, and passed between it and Oghao, the
channel being two miles broad, safe and without
soundings. While we were in the passage, we had
little wind and calms. This gave time for a large
sailing double canoe, which had been following us all
the day, as well as some others with paddles, to come
up with us.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had now an opportunity to verify a thing I was
before in doubt about; which was, whether or no
some of these canoes did not, in changing tacks, only
shift the sail, and so proceed with that end foremost
which before was the stern; the one we now saw
wrought in this manner; the sail is latteen, extended
to a latteen yard above, and to a boom at the foot;
in one word, it is like a whole mizzen, supposing the
whole foot to be extended to a boom. The yard is
slung nearly in the middle, or upon an equipoise.
When they change tacks, they throw the vessel up in
the wind, ease off the sheet, and bring the heel or
tack-end of the yard to the other end of the boat, and
the sheet in like manner: there are notches, or sockets,
at each end of the vessel in which the end of the
yard fixes. In short, they work just as those do at the
Ladrone Islands, according to Mr. Walter’s description.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
When they want to sail large, or before the
wind, the yard is taken out of the socket and squared.
It must be observed, that all their sailing vessels are
not rigged to sail in the same manner; some, and
those of the largest size, are rigged so as to tack
about. These have a short but pretty stout mast,
which steps on a kind of roller that is fixed to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>deck near the fore-part. It is made to lean or incline
very much forward; the head is forked; on the
two points of which the yard rests, as on two pivots,
by means of two strong cleats of wood secured to
each side of the yard, at about one-third its length
from the tack or heel, which, when under sail, is confined
down between the two canoes, by means of
two strong ropes, one to and passing through a hole
at the head of each canoe; for, it must be observed,
that all the sailing vessels of this sort are double.
The tack being thus fixed, it is plain that, in changing
tacks, the vessels must be put about; the sail and
boom on the one tack will be clear of the mast, and
on the other it will lie against it, just as a whole
mizzen. However, I am not sure if they do not
sometimes unlace that part of the sail from the yard
which is between the tack and mast-head, and so
shift both sail and boom leeward of the mast. The
drawings which Mr. Hodges made of these vessels
seem to favour this supposition, and will not only
illustrate, but in a manner make the description of
them unnecessary. The out-riggers and ropes used
for shrouds, &amp;c. are all stout and strong. Indeed,
the sail, yard, and boom, are all together of such an
enormous weight, that strength is required.</p>

<p class='c000'>The summit of Amattafoa was hid in the clouds
the whole day, so that we were not able to determine
with certainty whether there was a volcano or no;
but every thing we could see concurred to make us
believe there was. This island is about five leagues
in circuit. Oghao is not so much; but more round
and peaked. They lie in the direction of N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W. from Anamocka, eleven or twelve leagues
distant: they are both inhabited; but neither of them
seemed fertile.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were <a id='hard'></a>hardly through the passage before we
got a fresh breeze at south. That moment, all the
natives made haste to be gone, and we steered to the
west, all sails set. I had some thoughts of touching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>at Amsterdam, as it lay not much out of the way;
but, as the wind was now, we could not fetch it; and
this was the occasion of my laying my design aside
altogether.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us now return to Anamocka, as it is called by
the natives. It is situated in the latitude of 20° 15ʹ
South, longitude 174° 31ʹ West, and was first discovered
by Tasman, and by him named Rotterdam.
It is of a triangular form, each side whereof is about
three and a half or four miles. A salt-water lake in
the middle of it occupies not a little of its surface,
and in a manner cuts off the S.&nbsp;E. angle. Round the
island, that is, from the N.&nbsp;W. to the south, round by
the north and east, lie scattered a number of small
isles, sand-banks, and breakers. We could see no
end to their extent to the north; and it is not impossible
that they reach as far south as Amsterdam,
or Tongatabu. These, together with Middleburg or
Eaoowee, and Pylstart, make a group, containing
about three degrees of latitude and two of longitude,
which I have named the Friendly Isles or Archipelago,
as a firm reliance and friendship seems to
subsist among their inhabitants, and their courteous
behaviour to strangers entitles them to that appellation;
under which we might perhaps extend their
group much farther, even down to Boscawen and
Keppel’s isles, discovered by Captain Wallis, and
lying nearly under the same meridian, and in the latitude
of 15° 53ʹ; for, from the little account I have
had of the people of these two isles, they seem to
have the same sort of friendly disposition we observed
in our Archipelago.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inhabitants, productions, &amp;c. of Rotterdam,
and the neighbouring isles, are the same as at Amsterdam.
Hogs and fowls are, indeed, much scarcer;
of the former having got but six, and not many of
the latter. Yams and shaddocks were what we got
the most of; other fruits were not so plenty. Not
half the isle is laid out in inclosed plantations as at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Amsterdam; but the parts which are not inclosed are
not less fertile or uncultivated. There is, however,
far more waste land on this isle, in proportion to its
size, than upon the other, and the people seem to be
much poorer; that is, in cloth, matting, ornaments,
&amp;c. which constitute a great part of the riches of the
South Sea islanders.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people of this isle seem to be more affected
with the leprosy, or some scrophulous disorder, than
any I have seen elsewhere. It breaks out in the face
more than any other part of the body. I have seen
several whose faces were ruined by it, and their noses
quite gone. In one of my excursions, happening to
peep into a house where one or more of them were,
one man only appeared at the door, or hole by which
I must have entered, and which he began to stop up,
by drawing several parts of a cord across it. But the
intolerable stench which came from his putrid face
was alone sufficient to keep me out, had the entrance
been ever so wide. His nose was quite gone, and his
whole face in one continued ulcer; so that the very
sight of him was shocking. As our people had not
all got clear of a certain disease they had contracted
at the Society isles, I took all possible care to prevent
its being communicated to the natives here; and
I have reason to believe my endeavours succeeded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having mentioned a house, it may not be amiss to
observe, that some here differ from those I saw at the
other isles; being inclosed or walled on every side
with reeds neatly put together, but not close. The
entrance is by a square hole about two and a half
feet each way. The form of these houses is an oblong
square; the floor or foundation every way
shorter than the eve, which is about four feet from
the ground. By this construction, the rain that falls
on the roof is carried off from the wall; which otherwise
would decay and rot.</p>

<p class='c000'>We did not distinguish any king, or leading chief,
or any person who took upon him the appearance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>supreme authority. The man and woman before
mentioned, whom I believed to be man and wife, interested
themselves on several occasions in our affairs;
but it was easy to see they had no great authority.
Amongst other things which I gave them as a reward
for their service, was a young dog and bitch, animals
which they have not, but are very fond of, and know
very well by name. They have some of the same
sort of earthen pots we saw at Amsterdam; and I am
of opinion they are of their own manufacture, or that
of some neighbouring isle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The road, as I have already mentioned, is on the
north side of the isle, just to the southward of the
southernmost cove; for there are two on this side.
The bank is of some extent, and the bottom free
from rocks, with twenty-five and twenty fathoms water,
one or two miles from the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fire-wood is very convenient to be got at, and easy
to be shipped off; but the water is so brackish that it
is not worth the trouble of carrying it on board;
unless one is in great distress for want of that article,
and can get no better. There is, however, better,
not only on this isle, but on others in the neighbourhood;
for the people brought us some in cocoa-nut
shells, which was as good as need be; but probably
the springs are too trifling to water a ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have already observed that the S.&nbsp;W. side of the
island is covered by a reef or reefs of rocks, and small
isles. If there be a sufficient depth of water between
them and the island, as there appeared to be, and a
good bottom, this would be a much securer place
for a ship to anchor in than that where we had our
station.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>On the 1st of July, at sun-rise, Amattafoa was still
in sight, bearing E. by N. distant twenty leagues.
Continuing our course to the west, we, the next day
at noon, discovered land bearing N.&nbsp;W. by W. for
which we steered; and, upon a nearer approach,
found it to be a small island. At 4 o’clock it bore,
from N.&nbsp;W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W. to N.&nbsp;W. by N. and, at the same
time, breakers were seen from the mast-head, extending
from W. to S.&nbsp;W. The day being too far
spent to make farther discoveries, we soon after
shortened sail, hauled the wind, and spent the night
making short boards, which, at daybreak, we found
had been so advantageous that we were further from
the island than we expected, and it was eleven o’clock
before we reached the N.&nbsp;W. or lee-side, where
anchorage and landing seemed practicable. In order
to obtain a knowledge of the former, I sent the
master with a boat to sound; and, in the mean time,
we stood on and off with the ship. At this time, four
or five people were seen on the reef, which lies round
the isle, and about three times that number on the
shore. As the boat advanced, those on the reef
retired, and joined the others; and when the boat
landed, they all fled to the woods. It was not long
before the boat returned, when the master informed
me that there were no soundings without the reef,
over which, in one place only, he found a boat-channel
of six feet water. Entering by it, he rowed in for
the shore, thinking to speak with the people, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>more than twenty in number, who were armed with
clubs and spears; but the moment he set his foot on
shore, they retired to the woods. He left on the
rocks some medals, nails, and a knife; which they,
no doubt, found, as some were seen near the place
afterwards. This island is not quite a league in
length, in the direction of N.&nbsp;E. and S.&nbsp;W. and not
half that in breadth. It is covered with wood, and
surrounded by a reef of coral rocks, which, in some
places, extend two miles from the shore. It seems to
be too small to contain many inhabitants; and probably
the few whom we saw may have come from
some isle in the neighbourhood to fish for turtle; as
many were seen near this reef, and occasioned that
name to be given to the island, which is situated in
latitude 19° 48ʹ South, longitude 178° 2ʹ West.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing breakers to the S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W., which I was
desirous of knowing the extent of before night, I left
Turtle isle, and stood for them. At two o’clock we
found they were occasioned by a coral bank of about
four or five leagues in circuit. By the bearing we
had taken, we knew these to be the same breakers we
had seen the preceding evening. Hardly any part
of this bank or reef is above water at the reflux of the
waves. The heads of some rocks are to be seen near
the edge of the reef, where it is the shoalest; for in
the middle is deep water. In short, this bank wants
only a few little islets to make it exactly like one of
the half-drowned isles so often mentioned. It lies
S.&nbsp;W. from Turtle island, about five or six miles,
and the channel between it and the reef of that isle
is three miles over. Seeing no more shoals or islands,
and thinking there might be turtle on this bank, two
boats were properly equipped and sent thither; but
returned without having seen one.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boats were now hoisted in, and we made sail
to the west, with a brisk gale at east, which continued
till the 9th, when we had, for a few hours, a
breeze at N.&nbsp;W. attended with squalls of rain. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>was succeeded by a steady fresh gale at S.&nbsp;E. with
which we steered N.&nbsp;W. being at this time in the latitude
of 20° 20ʹ South, longitude 176° 8ʹ East.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 15th at noon, being in the latitude of
15° 9ʹ South, longitude 171° 16ʹ East, I steered west.
The next day the weather was foggy, and the wind
blew in heavy squalls, attended with rain, which in
this ocean, within the tropics, generally indicates the
vicinity of some high land. This was verified at
three in the afternoon, when high land was seen bearing
S.&nbsp;W. Upon this we took in the small sails,
reefed the top-sails, and hauling up for it, at half
past five, we could see it extend from S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. to
N.&nbsp;W. by W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W. Soon after we tacked and spent
the night, which was very stormy, in plying. Our
boards were disadvantageous; for, in the morning,
we found we had lost ground. This, indeed, was
no wonder, for having an old suit of sails bent,
the most of them were split to pieces; particularly a
fore-top-sail, which was rendered quite useless. We
got others to the yards, and continued to ply, being
desirous of getting round the south ends of the lands,
or at least so far to the south as to be able to judge
of their extent in that direction. For no one doubted
that this was the Australia del Espiritu Santo of
Quiros, which M. de Bougainville calls the Great
Cyclades, and that the coast we were now upon was
the east side of Aurora island, whose longitude is
168° 30ʹ East.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gale kept increasing till we were reduced to
our low sails; so that, on the 18th, at seven in the
morning, I gave over plying, set the topsails double-reefed,
bore up for, and hauled round the north end of
Aurora island, and then stretched over for the Isle of
Lepers, under close-reefed topsails and courses, with
a very hard gale at N.&nbsp;E.; but we had now the advantage
of a smooth sea, having the Isle of Aurora to
windward. At noon the north end of it bore N.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
N. distant four leagues; our latitude, found by double
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>altitudes, and reduced to this time, was 15° 1ʹ 30ʺ
South, longitude 168° 14ʹ East. At two o’clock
P.&nbsp;M. we drew near the middle of the Isle of Lepers,
and tacked about two miles from land; in which
situation we had no soundings with a line of seventy
fathoms. We now saw people on the shore, and
many beautiful cascades of water pouring down the
neighbouring hills. The next time we stood for this
isle, we came to within half a mile of it, where we
found thirty fathoms, a sandy bottom; but a mile off
we had no soundings at seventy fathoms. Here two
canoes came off to us, in one of which were three
men, and in the other but one. Though we made
all the signs of friendship, we could not bring them
nearer than a stone’s throw; and they made but a
short stay before they retired ashore, where we saw
a great number of people assembled in parties, and
armed with bows and arrows. They are of a very
dark colour, and, excepting some ornaments at their
breast and arms, seemed to be entirely naked.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I intended to get to the south, in order to explore
the land which might lie there, we continued
to ply between the Isle of Lepers and Aurora; and
on the 19th, at noon, the south end of the last-mentioned
isle bore South 24° East, and the north
end north, distant twenty miles. Latitude observed
15° 11ʺ. The wind continued to blow strong at S.&nbsp;E.,
so that what we got by plying in the day, we lost in
the night. On the 20th, at sunrise, we found ourselves
off the south end of Aurora, on the N.&nbsp;W. side
of which the coast forms a small bay. In this we
made some trips to try for anchorage; but found no
less than eighty fathoms water, the bottom a fine
dark sand, at half a mile from shore. Nevertheless,
I am of opinion that, nearer, there is much less depth,
and secure riding; and in the neighbourhood is
plenty of fresh water and wood for fuel. The whole
isle, from the sea-shore to the summits of the hills,
seemed to be covered with the latter; and every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>valley produced a fine stream of the former. We saw
people on the shore, and some canoes on the coast,
but none came off to us. Leaving the bay just mentioned,
we stretched across the channel which divides
Aurora from Whitsuntide island. At noon we
were abreast of the north end of this latter, which
bore E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. and observed in 15° 28ʹ
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>.</span>
The Isle of
Aurora bore from N. to N.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E. and the Isle of
Lepers from N. by W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W. to West. Whitsuntide
Isle appeared joined to the land to the S. and S.&nbsp;W.
of it; but in stretching to S.&nbsp;W. we discovered the
separation. This was about four o’clock P.&nbsp;M., and
then we tacked and stretched in for the island till
near sunset, when the wind veering more to the east
made it necessary to resume our course to the south.
We saw people on the shore, smokes in many parts
of the island, and several places which seemed to be
cultivated. About midnight, drawing near the south
land, we tacked and stretched to the north, in order
to spend the remainder of the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>At daybreak on the 21st, we found ourselves before
the channel that divides Whitsuntide island
from the south land, which is about two leagues
over. At this time, the land to the southward extended
from S. by E. round to the west farther than
the eye could reach, and on the part nearest to us,
which is of considerable height, we observed two
very large columns of smoke, which, I judged, ascended
from volcanos. We now stood S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. with
a fine breeze at S.&nbsp;E., and at ten o’clock, discovered
this part of the land to be an island which is called
by the natives Ambrym. Soon after an elevated
land appeared open off the south end of Ambrym;
and after that, another still higher, on which is a high
peaked hill. We judged these lands to belong to two
separate islands. The first came in sight at S.&nbsp;E.
the second at E. by S., and they appeared to be
ten leagues distant. Holding on our course for the
land ahead, at noon it was five miles distant from us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>extending from S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. to N.&nbsp;W. by W. and appeared
to be continued. The islands to the east bore from
N.&nbsp;E. by E. to S.&nbsp;E. by E., latitude observed 16° 17ʹ
South. As we drew nearer the shore we discovered
a creek, which had the appearance of being a good
harbour, formed by a low point or peninsula, projecting
out to the north. On this a number of people
were assembled, who seemed to invite us ashore;
probably with no good intent, as the most of them
were armed with bows and arrows. In order to gain
room and time to hoist out and arm our boats, to reconnoitre
this place, we tacked and made a trip off,
which occasioned the discovery of another port about
a league more to the south. Having sent two armed
boats to sound, and look for anchorage, on their making
the signal for the latter, we sailed in S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W.
and anchored in eleven fathoms water, not two
cables’ length from the S.&nbsp;E. shore, and a mile within
the entrance.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had no sooner anchored than several of the
natives came off in canoes. They were very cautious
at first; but, at last, trusted themselves along-side,
and exchanged, for pieces of cloth, arrows; some of
which were pointed with bone, and dipped in some
green gummy substance, which we naturally suppose
was poisonous. Two men having ventured on board,
after a short stay I sent them away with presents.
Others probably induced by this, came off by moonlight;
but I gave orders to permit none to come
along-side; by which means we got clear of them for
the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning early, a good many came round us,
some in canoes, and others swimming. I soon prevailed
on one to come on board; which he no sooner
did than he was followed by more than I desired;
so that not only our deck but rigging was presently
filled with them. I took four into the cabin, and
gave them various articles, which they showed to
those in the canoes, and seemed much pleased with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>their reception. While I was thus making friends
with those in the cabin, an accident happened that
threw all into confusion, but in the end, I believe,
proved advantageous to us. A fellow in a canoe
having been refused admittance into one of our boats
that lay along-side, bent his bow to shoot a poisoned
arrow at the boat-keeper. Some of his countrymen
prevented his doing it that instant, and gave time to
acquaint me with it. I ran instantly on deck, and
saw another man struggling with him; one of those
who had been in the cabin, and had leapt out of the
window for this purpose. The other seemed resolved,
shook him off, and directed his bow again to the boat-keeper;
but on my calling to him, pointed it at
me. Having a musket in my hand, loaded with
small shot, I gave him the contents. This staggered
him for a moment, but did not prevent him from
holding his bow still in the attitude of shooting.
Another discharge of the same nature made him
drop it, and the others, who were in the canoe, to
paddle off with all speed. At this time, some began
to shoot arrows on the other side. A musket
discharged in the air had no effect; but a four-pound
shot over their heads sent them off in the utmost
confusion. Many quitted their canoes and swam on
shore: those in the great cabin leaped out of the
windows; and those who were on the deck, and
on different parts of the rigging, all leaped over-board.
After this we took no farther notice of them,
but suffered them to come off and pick up their
canoes; and some even ventured again along-side
the ship. Immediately after the great gun was fired,
we heard the beating of drums on shore; which was,
probably, the signal for the country to assemble in
arms. We now got every thing in <a id='ready'></a>readiness to land,
to cut some wood, of which we were in want, and
to try to get some refreshments, nothing of this kind
having been seen in any of the canoes.</p>

<p class='c000'>About nine o’clock, we put off in two boats, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>landed in the face of four or five hundred people,
who were assembled on the shore. Though they
were all armed with bows and arrows, clubs and
spears, they made not the least opposition. On the
contrary, seeing me advance alone, with nothing but
a green branch in my hand, one of them, who seemed
to be a chief, giving his bow and arrows to another,
met me in the water, bearing also a green branch,
which having exchanged for the one I held, he then
took me by the hand, and led me up to the crowd.
I immediately distributed presents to them, and, in
the mean time, the marines were drawn upon the
beach. I then made signs (for we understood not a
word of their language) that we wanted wood; and
they made signs to us to cut down the trees. By
this time, a small pig being brought down and presented
to me, I gave the bearer a piece of cloth, with
which he seemed well pleased. This made us hope
that we should soon have some more; but we were
mistaken. The pig was not brought to be exchanged
for what we had, but on some other account; probably
as a peace-offering. For all we could say or
do did not prevail on them to bring down, after this,
above half-a-dozen cocoa-nuts, and a small quantity
of fresh water. They set no value on nails, or any
sort of iron tools; nor indeed on any thing we had.
They would, now and then, exchange an arrow for
a piece of cloth; but very seldom would part with a
bow. They were unwilling we should go off the
beach, and very desirous we should return on board.
At length, about noon, after sending what wood we
had cut on board, we embarked ourselves; and they
all retired, some one way and some another.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before we had dined, the afternoon was too far
spent to do any thing on shore; and all hands were
employed, setting up the rigging, and repairing some
defects in it. But seeing a man bring along the
strand a buoy, which they had taken in the night
from the kedge-anchor, I went on shore for it, accompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>by some of the gentlemen. The moment
we landed, it was put into the boat, by a man who
walked off again without speaking one word. It
ought to be observed, that this was the only thing
they took, or even attempted to take from us, by
any means whatever. Being landed near some of
their plantations and houses, which were just within
the skirts of the woods, I prevailed on one man to
conduct me to them; but, though they suffered
Mr. Forster to go with me, they were unwilling any
more should follow. These houses were something
like those of the other isles; rather low, and covered
with palm thatch; some were inclosed, or walled
round with boards; and the entrance to these was by
a square hole at one end, which at this time was
shut up, and they were unwilling to open it for us
to look in. There were here about six houses, and
some small plantations of roots, &amp;c. fenced round
with reeds as at the Friendly Isles. There were,
likewise, some bread-fruit, cocoa-nut, and plaintain-trees;
but very little fruit on any of them. A good
many fine yams were piled up upon sticks, or a kind
of raised platform; and about twenty pigs, and a
few fowls, were running about loose. After making
these observations, having embarked, we proceeded
to the S.&nbsp;E. point of the harbour, where we again
landed and walked along the beach till we could see
the islands to the S.&nbsp;E. already mentioned. The
names of these we now obtained, as well as the name
of that on which we were. This they called Mallicollo<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c009'><sup>[2]</sup></a>:
the island that first appeared over the south
end of Ambrym is called Apee; and the other, with
the hill on it, Paoom. We found on the beach a
fruit like an orange, called by them Abbi-mora, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>whether it be fit for eating, I cannot say, as this was
decayed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Proceeding next to the other side of the harbour, we
there landed, near a few houses, at the invitation of
some people who came down to the shore; but we had
not been there five minutes before they wanted us to
be gone. We complied, and proceeded up the harbour
in order to sound it, and to look for fresh water, of
which, as yet, we had seen none, but the very little
that the natives brought, which we knew not where
they got. Nor was our search now attended with
success; but this is no proof that there is not any.
The day was too far spent to examine the place well
enough to determine this point. Night having
brought us on board, I was informed that no soul
had been off to the ship; so soon was the curiosity of
these people satisfied. As we were coming on board,
we heard the sound of a drum, and, I think, of
some other instruments, and saw people dancing;
but as soon as they heard the noise of the oars, or saw
us, all was silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being unwilling to lose the benefit of the moonlight
nights, which now happened, at seven A.&nbsp;M.
on the 23d we weighed; and, with a light air of
wind, and the assistance of our boats, proceeded out
of the harbour; the south end of which, at noon,
bore W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. distant about two miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the natives saw us under sail, they came off
in canoes, making exchanges with more confidence
than before, and giving such extraordinary proofs
of their honesty as surprised us. As the ship
at first had fresh way through the water, several of
them dropped astern after they had received our
goods, and before they had time to deliver theirs in
return. Instead of taking advantage of this, as our
friends at the Society Isles would have done, they
used their utmost efforts to get up with us, and to
deliver what they had already been paid for. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>man, in particular, followed us a considerable time,
and did not reach us till it was calm, and the thing
was forgotten. As soon as he came along-side, he
held up the thing which several were ready to buy;
but he refused to part with it, till he saw the person
to whom he had before sold it, and to him he gave
it. The person not knowing him again, offered him
something in return, which he refused, and showed
him what he had given him before. Pieces of cloth
and marbled paper were in most esteem with them;
but edge tools, nails, and beads, they seemed to disregard.
The greatest number of canoes we had
alongside at once did not exceed eight, and not more
than four or five people in each; who would frequently
retire to the shore all on a sudden, before
they had disposed of half their things, and then others
would come off.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the time we came out of the harbour, it was
about low water, and great numbers of people were
then on the shoals or reefs which lie along the shore,
looking, as we supposed, for shell and other fish.
Thus our being on their coast, and in one of their
ports, did not hinder them from following the
necessary employments. By this time they might be
satisfied we meant them no harm; so that, had we
made a longer stay, we might soon have been upon
good terms with this ape-like nation; for, in general,
they are the most ugly, ill-proportioned people
I ever saw, and in every respect different from any
we had met with in this sea. They are a very dark-coloured
and rather diminutive race; with long
heads, flat faces, and monkey countenances. Their
hair mostly black or brown, is short and curly;
but not quite so soft and woolly as that of a negro.
Their beards are very strong, crisp, and bushy, and
generally black and short. But what most adds to
their deformity, is a belt, or cord, which they wear
round the waist, and tie so tight over the belly that
the shape of their bodies is not unlike that of an overgrown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>pismire. The men go quite naked, except a
piece of cloth or leaf used as a wrapper.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c009'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We saw but few women, and they were not less
ugly than the men; their heads, faces, and shoulders
are painted red; they wear a kind of petticoat;
and some of them had something over their shoulders
like a bag, in which they carry their children. None
of them came off to the ship, and they generally kept
at a distance when we were on shore. Their ornaments
are ear-rings made of tortoise-shell and bracelets.
A curious one of the latter, four or five inches
broad, wrought with thread or cord, and studded
with shells, is worn by them just above the elbow.
Round the right wrist they wear hogs’ tusks bent circular,
and rings made of shells; and round their
left, a round piece of wood, which we judged was to
ward off the bow-string. The bridge of the nose is
pierced, in which they wear a piece of white stone,
about an inch and a half long, and
in this shape.
<a href="images/i_039a.jpg"><img src="images/i_039a.jpg"
style="width:300px;" alt="Illustration of curved stone" /></a>
As signs of friendship
they present a green branch, and sprinkle water with
the hand over the head.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their weapons are clubs, spears, and bows and
arrows. The two former are made of hard or
iron wood. Their bows are about four feet long,
made of a stick split down the middle, and are
not circular, but in this form.
<a href="images/i_039b.jpg"><img src="images/i_039b.jpg"
style="width:300px;" alt="Illustration of bow" /></a>
The arrows, which are a sort of
reeds, are sometimes armed with a long and sharp
point, made of the hard wood, and sometimes
with a very hard point made of bone; and these points
are all covered with a substance which we took for
poison. Indeed, the people themselves confirmed our
suspicions, by making signs to us not to touch the
point, and giving us to understand, that if we were
pricked by them we should die. They are very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>careful of them themselves, and keep them always
wrapped up in a quiver. Some of these arrows are
armed with two or three points, each with small
prickles on the edges, to prevent the arrow being
drawn out of the wound.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people of Mallicollo seemed to be a quite different
nation from any we had yet met with, and
speak a different language. Of about eighty words
which Mr. Forster collected, hardly one bears any
affinity to the language spoken at any other island
or place I had ever been at. The letter R is used
in many of their words; and frequently two or
three being joined together, such words we found
difficult to pronounce. I observed that they could
pronounce most of our words with great ease. They
express their admiration by hissing like a goose.</p>

<p class='c000'>To judge of the country by the little we saw of it,
it must be fertile; but I believe their fruits are not
so good as those of the Society or Friendly Isles.
Their cocoa-nut trees, I am certain, are not; and
their bread-fruit and plantains did not seem much
better. But their yams appeared to be very good.
We saw no other animals than those I have already
mentioned. They have not so much as a name for a
dog, and consequently have none; for which reason we
left them a dog and a bitch; and there is no doubt
they will be taken care of, as they were very fond of
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>After we had got to sea, we tried what effect one
of the poisoned arrows would have on a dog. Indeed
we had tried it in the harbour the very first night,
but we thought the operation had been too slight, as
it had no effect. The surgeon now made a deep
incision in the dog’s thigh, into which he laid a
large portion of the poison just as it was scraped
from the arrows, and then bound up the wound with
a bandage. For several days after, we thought the
dog was not so well as he had been before; but
whether this was really so, or only suggested by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>imagination, I know not. He was afterwards as if
nothing had been done to him, and lived to be
brought home to England. However, I have no
doubt of this stuff being of a poisonous quality, as it
could answer no other purpose. The people seemed
not unacquainted with the nature of poison; for when
they brought us water on shore, they first tasted it,
and then gave us to understand we might with safety
drink it.</p>

<p class='c000'>This harbour, which is situated on the N.&nbsp;E. side
of Mallicollo, not far from the S.&nbsp;E. end, in latitude
16° 25ʹ 20ʺ S., longitude 167° 57ʹ 23ʺ E., I named
Port Sandwich. It lies in S.&nbsp;W. by S. about one
league, and is one-third of a league broad. A reef of
rocks extends out a little way from each point; but the
channel is of a good breadth, and hath in it from
forty to twenty-four fathoms water. In the port, the
depth of water is from twenty to four fathoms; and
it is so sheltered that no winds can disturb a ship at
anchor there. Another great advantage is, you can
lie so near the shore as to cover your people who may
be at work upon it.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>Soon after we got to sea, we had a breeze at
E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. with which we stood over for Ambrym till
three o’clock in the afternoon, when the wind veering
to E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. we tacked and stretched to the S.&nbsp;E. and
weathered the S.&nbsp;E. end of Mallicollo, off which we
discovered three or four small islands, that before
appeared to be connected. At sun-set the point
bore S. 77° West, distant three leagues, from which
the coast seemed to trend away West. At this time
the isle of Ambrym extended from N. 30° E. to N.
65° E. The isle of Paoom from N. 76° E. to S. 88°
E. and the isle of Apee from S. 83° E. to S. 43° East.
We stood for this last isle, which we reached by
midnight, and then brought to till day-break on the
24th, when we made sail to the S.&nbsp;E. with a view of
plying up to the eastward on the south side of Apee.
At sun-rise, we discovered several more islands, extending
from the S.&nbsp;E. point of Apee to the South
as far as S.&nbsp;E. by S. The nearest to us we reached
by ten o’clock, and not being able to weather it, we
tacked a mile from its shore in fourteen fathoms
water. This island is about 4 leagues in circuit, is
remarkable by having three high peaked hills upon
it, by which it has obtained that name. In the P.&nbsp;M.
the wind veering more to the north, we resumed our
course to the east; and having weathered Threehills,
stood for the group of small isles which lie off the
S.&nbsp;E. point of Apee. These I called Shepherd’s Isles,
in honour of my worthy friend Dr. Shepherd,
Plumian professor of astronomy at Cambridge. Having
a fine breeze, I had thoughts of going through
between them; but the channels being narrow, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>seeing broken water in the one we were steering for,
I gave up the design, and bore up, in order to go
without, or to the south of them. Before this could
be accomplished, it fell calm, and we were left to the
mercy of the current, close to the isles, where we
could find no soundings with a line of an hundred
and eighty fathoms. We had now lands or islands
in every direction, and were not able to count the
number which lay round us. The mountain on
Paoom was seen over the east end of Apee, bearing
N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. at eight o’clock. A breeze at S.&nbsp;E. relieved
us from the anxiety the calm had occasioned;
and we spent the night making short boards.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night before we came out of Port Sandwich,
two reddish fish, about the size of large bream, and
not unlike them, were caught with hook and line.
On these fish most of the officers, and some of the
petty officers, dined the next day. The night following,
every one who had eaten of them was
seized with violent pains in the head and bones,
attended with a scorching heat all over the skin,
and numbness in the joints. There remained no
doubt that this was occasioned by the fish being of
a poisonous nature, and having communicated its
bad effects to all who partook of them; even to the
hogs and dogs. One of the former died about
sixteen hours after; it was not long before one of
the latter shared the same fate; and it was a week or
ten days, before all the gentlemen recovered. These
must have been the same sort of fish mentioned by
Quiros<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c009'><sup>[4]</sup></a>, under the name of Pargos, which poisoned
the crews of his ships, so that it was some time before
they recovered; and we should, doubtless, have been
in the same situation, had more of them been eaten.</p>

<p class='c000'>At day-break on the 25th, we made a short stretch
to the east of Shepherd’s Isles till after sun-rise,
when, seeing no more land in that direction, we
tacked and stood for the island we had seen in the
south, having a gentle breeze at S.&nbsp;E. We passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>to the east of Threehills, and likewise of a low isle,
which lies on the S.&nbsp;E. side of it, between a remarkable
peaked rock which obtained the name of Monument,
and a small island named Twohills, on account
of two peaked hills upon it, disjoined by a low
and narrow isthmus. The channel between this
island and the Monument is near a mile broad, and
twenty-four fathoms deep. Except this rock, which
is only accessible to birds, we did not find an island
on which people were not seen. At noon, we observed,
in latitude 17° 18ʹ 30ʺ longitude, made from
Port Sandwich, 45ʹ East. In this situation the
Monument bore N. 16° East, distant two miles;
Twohills bore N. 25° West, distant two miles, and in
a line with the S.&nbsp;W. part of Threehills; and the islands
to the South extended from S. 16° 30ʹ E. to
S. 42° West.</p>

<p class='c000'>Continuing our course to the south, at five P.&nbsp;M.
we drew near the southern lands, which we found to
consist of one large island, whose southern and
western extremities extended beyond our sight, and
three or four smaller ones, lying off its north side.
The two northernmost are much the largest, have a
good height, and lie in the direction of E. by S. and
W. by N. from each other, distant two leagues. I
named the one Montagu, and the other Hinchinbrook,
and the large island Sandwich, in honour of
my noble patron the earl of Sandwich. Seeing broken
water a-head between Montagu and Hinchinbrook
Isles, we tacked; and soon after it fell calm. The
calm continued till seven o’clock the next morning,
when it was succeeded by a breeze from the westward.
During the calm, having been carried by the
currents and a S.&nbsp;E. swell, four leagues to the W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W.
we passed Hinchinbrook Isle, saw the western
extremity of Sandwich Island, bearing S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W.
about five leagues distant, and at the same time discovered
a small island to the west of this direction.
After getting the westerly breeze, I steered S.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>order to pass between Montagu Isle and the north
end of Sandwich Island. At noon we were in the
middle of the channel, and observed in latitude 17°
31ʹ South. The distance from one island to the
other is about four or five miles; but the channel is
not much above half that breadth, being contracted
by breakers. We had no soundings in it with a line
of forty fathoms.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we passed Montagu Isle several people came
down to the sea-side, and, by signs, seemed to invite
us ashore. Some were also seen on Sandwich Island,
which exhibited a most delightful prospect, being
spotted with woods and lawns, agreeably diversified,
over the whole surface. It hath a gentle slope from
the hills, which are of a moderate height, down to
the sea-coast. This is low and guarded by a chain
of breakers, so that there is no approaching it at this
part. But more to the west, beyond Hinchinbrook
Island, there seemed to run in a bay sheltered from
the reigning winds. The examining it not being so
much an object with me as the getting to the south,
in order to find the southern extremity of the Archipelago,
with this view I steered S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. being the
direction of the coast of Sandwich Island. We had
but just got through the passage, before the west
wind left us to variable light airs and calms; so that
we were apprehensive of being carried back again
by the currents, or rather of being obliged to return
in order to avoid being driven on the shoals, as there
was no anchorage, a line of an hundred and sixty
fathoms not reaching to the bottom. At length a
breeze springing up at S.&nbsp;W. we stood to S.&nbsp;E. and
at sun-set the Monument bore N. 14° 30ʹ West, and
Montagu Island N. 28° West, distant three leagues.
We judged we saw the S.&nbsp;E. extremity of Sandwich
Island bearing about S. by E.</p>

<p class='c000'>We continued to stand to S.&nbsp;E. till four A.&nbsp;M. on
the 27th, when we tacked to the west. At sun-rise
having discovered a new land bearing south, and
making in three hills, this occasioned us to tack and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>stand towards it. At this time Montagu Isle bore
N. 52° West, distant thirteen leagues; at noon it was
nearly in the same direction, and the new land extended
from S.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E. to S. by W. and three hills
seemed to be connected. Our latitude, by observation,
was 18° 1ʹ S. and the longitude, made from
Port Sandwich, 1° 23ʹ E. We continued to stand to
the S.&nbsp;E. with a gentle breeze at S.&nbsp;W. and S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. till
the 28th at sun-rise, when, the wind veering to the
south, we tacked and stood to the west. The three
hills mentioned above, we now saw belonged to one
island, which extended from S. 35° to 71° West, distant
about ten or twelve leagues.</p>

<p class='c000'>Retarded by contrary winds, calms, and the currents
that set to N.&nbsp;W., we were three days in gaining
this space; in which time we discovered an
elevated land to the south of this. It first appeared
in detached hummocks, but we judged it to be connected.
At length, on the 1st of August, about ten
A.&nbsp;M. we got a fine breeze at E.&nbsp;S. E. which soon
after veered to N.&nbsp;E. and we steered for the N.&nbsp;W.
side of the island. Reaching it about two P.&nbsp;M. we
ranged the west coast at one mile from shore, on
which the inhabitants appeared in several parts, and
by signs invited us to land. We continued to sound
without finding bottom, till we came before a small
bay, or bending of the coast, where, near a mile
from shore, we found thirty and twenty-two fathoms
water, a sandy bottom. I had thoughts of anchoring
here, but the wind almost instantly veered to N.&nbsp;W.,
which being nearly on shore, I laid this design aside.
Besides, I was unwilling to lose the opportunity that
now offered of getting to the south-east, in order
first to explore the lands which lay there. I therefore
continued to range the coast to the south, at
about the same distance from shore; but we soon
got out of soundings. About a league to the south
of this bay, which hath about two miles extent, is
another more extensive. Towards the evening, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>breeze began to abate, so that it was sun-set before
we got the length of it. I intended not to stop
here, and stand to the south under an easy sail all
night, but at eight o’clock, as we were steering
S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. we saw a light a-head. Not knowing but it
might be on some low detached isle, dangerous to
approach while dark, we hauled the wind, and spent
the night standing off and on, or rather driving to
and fro; for we had but very little wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>At sun-rise on the 2d, we saw no more land than
the coast we were upon; but found that the currents
had carried us some miles to the north, and we attempted,
to little purpose, to regain what we had
lost. At noon we were about a league from the coast,
which extended from S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. to N.&nbsp;E. Latitude observed
18° 46ʹ S. In the afternoon, finding the ship
to drift, not only to the north, but in shore also, and
being yet to the south of the bay we passed the day
before, I had thoughts of getting to an anchor before
night, while we had it in our power to make choice
of a place. With this view, having hoisted out two
boats, one of them was sent a-head to tow the ship;
in the other Mr. Gilbert went, to sound for anchorage.
Soon after, the towing boat was sent to assist
him. So much time was spent in sounding this
bay, that the ship drove past, which made it necessary
to call the boats on board to tow her off from the
northern point. But this service was performed by
a breeze of wind, which, that moment, sprung up
at S.&nbsp;W., so that as the boats got on board, we hoisted
them in, and then bore up for the north side of the
island, intending once more to try to get round by
the east. Mr. Gilbert informed me, that, at the
south part of the bay, he found no soundings till
close to a steep stone beach, where he landed to taste
a stream of water he saw there, which proved to be
salt. Some people were seen there, but they kept
at a distance. Farther down the coast, that is to the
north, he found twenty, twenty-four, and thirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>fathoms, three-fourths of a mile, or a mile from shore,
the bottom a fine dark sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 3d, at sun-rise, we found ourselves abreast
a lofty promontory on the S.&nbsp;E. side of the island,
and about three leagues from it. Having but little
wind, and that from the south, right in our teeth,
and being in want of fire-wood, I sent Lieutenant
Clerke with two boats to a small islot which lies off the
promontory, to endeavour to get some. In the mean
time we continued to ply up with the ship; but what
we gained by our sails, we lost by the current. At
length, towards noon, we got a breeze at E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. and
E. with which we could lie up for the head; and soon
after Mr. Clerke returned, having not been able to
land, on account of an high surf on the shore. They
met with no people on the isle; but saw a large bat,
and some birds, and caught a water-snake. At six
o’clock P.&nbsp;M. we got in with the land, under the N.&nbsp;W. side of the head, where we anchored in seventeen
fathoms water, the bottom a fine dark sand, half
a mile from shore; the point of the head bearing N.
18° East, distant half a league; the little islot
before mentioned N.&nbsp;E. by E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E. and the N.&nbsp;W.
point of the bay N. 32° West. Many people appeared
on the shore, and some attempted to swim off
to us; but having occasion to send the boat a-head to
sound, they retired as she drew near them. This,
however, gave us a favourable idea of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 4th, at day-break, I went with two boats
to examine the coast, to look for a proper landing-place,
wood, and water. At this time, the natives
began to assemble on the shore, and by signs invited
us to land. I went first to a small beach, which is
towards the head, where I found no good landing,
on account of some rocks which every where lined the
coast. I, however, put the boat’s bow to the shore,
and gave cloth, medals, &amp;c. to some people who
were there. For this treatment they offered to haul
the boats over the breakers to the sandy beach; which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>I thought a friendly offer, but had reason afterwards
to alter my opinion. When they found I would not
do as they desired, they made signs for us to go down
into the bay, which we accordingly did, and they ran
along shore abreast of us, their number increasing
prodigiously. I put into the shore in two or three
places, but, not liking the situation, did not land.
By this time, I believe, the natives conceived what
I wanted, as they directed me round a rocky point,
where, on a fine sandy beach, I stepped out of the
boat without wetting a foot, in the face of a vast
multitude, with only a green branch in my hand,
which I had before got from one of them. I took
but one man out of the boat with me, and ordered the
other boat to lie to a little distance off. They received
me with great courtesy and politeness, and would
retire back from the boat on my making the least
motion with my hand. A man whom I took to be a
chief, seeing this, made them form a semicircle round
the boat’s bow, and beat such as attempted to break
through this order. This man I loaded with presents,
giving likewise to others, and asked by signs for fresh
water, in hopes of seeing where they got it. The
chief immediately sent a man for some, who ran to
a house, and presently returned with a little in a
bamboo; so that I gained but little information by
this. I next asked, by the same means, for something
to eat; and they as readily brought me a yam,
and some cocoa-nuts. In short, I was charmed with
their behaviour; and the only thing which could give
the least suspicion was, that most of them were armed
with clubs, spears, darts, and bows and arrows. For
this reason I kept my eye continually upon the chief,
and watched his looks as well as his actions. He
made many signs to me to haul the boat up upon the
shore, and at last slipped into the crowd, where I observed
him speak to several people, and then return
to me, repeating signs to haul the boat up, and hesitating
a good deal before he would receive some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>spike-nails which I then offered him. This made me
suspect something was intended, and immediately I
stepped into the boat, telling them by signs that I
should soon return. But they were not for parting
so soon, and now attempted, by force, what they
could not obtain by gentler means. The gang-board
happened unluckily to be laid out for me to come into
the boat. I say unluckily, for if it had not been out,
and if the crew had been a little quicker in getting
the boat off, the natives might not have had time to
put their design in execution, nor would the following
disagreeable scene have happened. As we were
putting off the boat, they laid hold of the gang-board,
and unhooked it off the boat’s stern, but as
they did not take it away, I thought this had been
done by accident, and ordered the boat in again to
take it up. Then they themselves hooked it over the
boat’s stern, and attempted to haul her ashore; others,
at the same time, snatched the oars out of the people’s
hands. On my pointing a musket at them,
they in some measure desisted, but returned in an
instant, seemingly determined to haul the boat ashore.
At the head of this party was the chief; the others,
who could not come at the boat, stood behind with
darts, stones, and bows and arrows in hand, ready to
support them. Signs and threats having no effect,
our own safety became the only consideration; and
yet I was unwilling to fire on the multitude, and resolved
to make the chief alone fall a victim to his
own treachery; but my musket at this critical moment
missed fire. Whatever idea they might have
formed of the arms we held in our hands, they must
now have looked upon them as childish weapons, and
began to let us see how much better theirs were, by
throwing stones and darts, and by shooting arrows.
This made it absolutely necessary for me to give orders
to fire. The first discharge threw them into confusion;
but a second was hardly sufficient to drive
them off the beach; and, after all, they continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>to throw stones from behind the trees and bushes,
and, every now and then, to pop out and throw a
dart. Four lay, to all appearance, dead on the shore;
but two of them afterwards crawled into the bushes.
Happy it was for these people, that not half our
muskets would go off, otherwise many more must have
fallen. We had one man wounded in the cheek with
a dart, the point of which was as thick as my finger,
and yet it entered above two inches; which shews
that it must have come with great force, though indeed
we were very near them. An arrow struck Mr.
Gilbert’s naked breast, who was about thirty yards
off; but probably it had struck something before; for
it hardly penetrated the skin. The arrows were
pointed with hard wood.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as we got on board, I ordered the anchor
to be weighed, with a view of anchoring near the
landing-place. While this was doing, several people
appeared on the low rocky point, displaying two oars
we had lost in the scuffle. I looked on this as a sign
of submission, and of their wanting to give us the
oars. I was, nevertheless, prevailed on to fire a four
pound shot at them, to let them see the effect of our
great guns. The ball fell short, but frightened them
so much, that none were seen afterwards; and they
left the oars standing up against the bushes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was now calm; but the anchor was hardly at
the bow before a breeze sprung up at north, of which
we took the advantage, set our sails, and plyed out
of the bay, as it did not seem capable of supplying
our wants, with that conveniency I wished to have.
Besides, I always had it in my power to return to this
place, in case I should find none more convenient
farther south.</p>

<p class='c000'>These islanders seemed to be a different race from
those of Mallicollo, and spoke a different language.
They are of the middle size, have a good shape, and
tolerable features. Their colour is very dark, and
they paint their faces, some with black, and others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>with red pigment. Their hair is very curly and crisp,
and somewhat woolly. I saw a few women, and I
thought them ugly; they wore a kind of petticoat
made of palm leaves, or some plant like it. But the
men, like those of Mallicollo, were in a manner
naked; having only the belt about the waist, and the
piece of cloth, or leaf, used as a wrapper.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c009'><sup>[5]</sup></a> I saw
no canoes with these people, nor were any seen in
any part of this island. They live in houses covered
with thatch, and their plantations are laid out by line,
and fenced round.</p>

<p class='c000'>At two o’clock in the afternoon, we were clear of
the bay, bore up round the head, and steered S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.
for the south end of the island, having a fine breeze
at N.&nbsp;W. On the S.&nbsp;W. side of the head is a pretty
deep bay, which seemed to run in behind the one on
the N.&nbsp;W. side. Its shores are low, and the adjacent
lands appeared very fertile. It is exposed to the S.&nbsp;E.
winds; for which reason, until it be better known, the
N.&nbsp;W. bay is preferable, because it is sheltered from
the reigning winds; and the winds to which it is
open, viz. from N.&nbsp;W. by N. to E. by N. seldom blow
strong. The promontory, or peninsula, which disjoins
these two bays, I named Traitor’s Head, from
the treacherous behaviour of its inhabitants. It is
the N.&nbsp;E. point of the island, situated in the latitude
18° 43ʹ south, longitude 169° 28ʹ east, and terminates
in a saddle hill which is of height sufficient to
be seen sixteen or eighteen leagues. As we advanced
to S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., the new island we had before discovered
began to appear over the S.&nbsp;E. point of the one near
us, bearing S.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E. distant ten or twelve leagues.
After leaving this one, we steered for the East end
of the other, being directed by a great light we saw
upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>At one o’clock the next morning, drawing near
the shore, we tacked, and spent the remainder of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>night making short boards. At sun-rise, we discovered
a high table land (an island) bearing E. by S.,
and a small low isle in the direction of N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. which
we had passed in the night without seeing it. Traitor’s
Head was still in sight, bearing N. 20° West, distant
fifteen leagues, and the island to the south extended
from S. 7° West to S. 87° West, distant three or four
miles. We then found that the light we had seen in
the night, was occasioned by a volcano, which we
observed to throw up vast quantities of fire and smoke,
with a rumbling noise heard at a great distance. We
now made sail for the island; and, presently after,
discovered a small inlet which had the appearance of
being a good harbour. In order to be better informed,
I sent away two armed boats, under the command
of Lieutenant Cooper, to sound it; and, in the mean
while, we stood on and off with the ship, to be ready
to follow, or give them any assistance they might
want. On the east point of the entrance, we observed
a number of people, and several houses and
canoes; and when our boats entered the harbour
they launched some, and followed them, but came
not near. It was not long before Mr. Cooper made
the signal for anchorage; and we stood in with the
ship. The wind being at west, and our course
S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W., we borrowed close to the west point, and
passed over some sunken rocks, which might have
been avoided by keeping a little more to the east, or
about one-third channel over. The wind left us as
soon as we were within the entrance, and obliged us
to drop an anchor in four fathoms water. After this,
the boats were sent again to sound; and, in the mean
time, the launch was hoisted out, in order to carry
out anchors to warp in by, as soon as we should be
acquainted with the channel.</p>

<p class='c000'>While we were thus employed, many of the natives
got together in parties, on several parts of the
shore, all armed with bows, spears, &amp;c. Some swam
off to us, others came in canoes. At first they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>shy, and kept at the distance of a stone’s throw; they
grew insensibly bolder; and, at last, came under
our stern, and made some exchanges. The people
in one of the first canoes, after coming as near as
they durst, threw towards us some cocoa-nuts. I
went into a boat and picked them up, giving them in
return some cloth and other articles. This induced
others to come under the stern, and alongside, where
their behaviour was insolent and daring. They
wanted to carry off every thing within their reach;
they got hold of the fly of the ensign, and would
have torn it from the staff; others attempted to knock
the rings off the rudder; but the greatest trouble
they gave us was to look after the buoys of our anchors,
which were no sooner thrown out of the boats,
or let go from the ship, than they got hold of them.
A few musquets fired in the air had no effect; but a
four-pounder frightened them so much, that they
quitted their canoes that instant, and took to the
water. But as soon as they found themselves unhurt,
they got again into their canoes; gave us some halloos;
flourished their weapons; and returned once
more to the buoys. This put us to the expence of a
few musketoon shot, which had the desired effect.
Although none were hurt, they were afterwards afraid
to come near the buoys; very soon all retired on
shore; and we were permitted to sit down to dinner
undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c000'>During these transactions, a friendly old man in a
small canoe made several trips between us and the
shore, bringing off each time a few cocoa-nuts, or a
yam, and taking in exchange whatever we gave him.
Another was on the gangway when the great gun was
fired, but I could not prevail on him to stay there
long. Towards the evening, after the ship was
moored, I landed at the head of the harbour, in the
S.&nbsp;E. corner, with a strong party of men, without
any opposition being made by a great number of the
natives who were assembled in two parties, the one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>on our right, the other on our left, armed with clubs,
darts, spears, slings, and stones, bows and arrows,
&amp;c. After distributing to the old people, (for we
could distinguish no chief,) and some others, presents
of cloth, medals, &amp;c., I ordered two casks to be
filled with water out of a pond about twenty paces
behind the landing-place; giving the natives to understand,
that this was one of the articles we wanted.
Besides water, we got from them a few cocoa-nuts,
which seemed to be in plenty on the trees; but they
could not be prevailed upon to part with any of their
weapons. These they held in constant readiness,
and in the proper attitudes of offence and defence;
so that little was wanting to make them attack us; at
least we thought so, by their pressing so much upon
us, and in spite of our endeavours to keep them off.
Our early re-embarking probably disconcerted their
scheme; and after that, they all retired. The friendly
old man before mentioned, was in one of these parties;
and we judged, from his conduct, that his temper
was pacific.</p>

  <h2 id='b3c5' class='c004'>CHAP. V.<br /> <br />AN INTERCOURSE ESTABLISHED WITH THE NATIVES; SOME ACCOUNT OF THE ISLAND; AND A VARIETY OF INCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED DURING OUR STAY AT IT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>As we wanted to take in a large quantity both of
wood and water, and as, when I was on shore, I had
found it practicable to lay the ship much nearer the
landing-place than she now was, which would greatly
facilitate that work, as well as over-awe the natives,
and enable us better to cover and protect the working
party on shore; with this view, on the 6th, we went
to work to transport the ship to the place I designed
to moor her in. While we were about this, we observed
the natives assembling from all parts, and
forming themselves into two parties, as they did the
preceding evening, one on each side the landing-place,
to the amount of some thousands, armed as
before. A canoe, sometimes conducted by one, and
at other times by two or three men, now and then
came off, bringing a few cocoa-nuts or plantains.
These they gave us without asking for any return;
but I took care that they should always have something.
Their chief design seemed to be to invite us on shore.
One of those who came off was the old man who
had already ingratiated himself into our favour. I
made him understand, by signs, that they were to
lay aside their weapons, took those which were in
the canoe and threw them overboard, and made him
a present of a large piece of cloth. There was no
doubt that he understood me, and made my request
known to his countrymen. For as soon as he landed
we observed him to go first to the one party, and then
to the other; nor was he, ever after, seen by us with
any thing like a weapon in his hand. After this,
three fellows came in a canoe under the stern, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>of them brandishing a club, with which he struck
the ship’s side, and committed other acts of defiance,
but at last offered to exchange it for a string of beads,
and some other trifles. These were sent down to
him by a line; but the moment they were in his possession,
he and his companions paddled off in all
haste, without giving the club, or any thing else, in
return. This was what I expected, and indeed what
I was not sorry for, as I wanted an opportunity to
show the multitude on shore the effect of our fire-arms,
without materially hurting any of them. Having
a fowling-piece, loaded with small shot, (No. 8.)
I gave the fellow the contents; and, when they were
above musket-shot off, I ordered some of the musketoons,
or wall-pieces, to be fired, which made
them leap out of the canoe, keep under her off side,
and swim with her ashore. This transaction seemed
to make little or no impression on the people there.
On the contrary, they began to halloo, and to make
sport of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>After mooring the ship, by four anchors, with her
broadside to the landing-place, hardly a musket-shot
off, and placing our artillery in such a manner
as to command the whole harbour, I embarked with
the marines, and a party of seamen, in three boats,
and rowed in for the shore. It hath been already
mentioned, that the two divisions of the natives were
drawn up on each side the landing-place. They had
left a space between them of about thirty or forty
yards, in which were laid, to the most advantage, a
few small bunches of plantains, a yam, and two or
three roots. Between these and the water were stuck
upright in the sand, for what purpose I never could
learn, four small reeds, about two feet from each
other, in a line at right angles to the shore, where
they remained for two or three days after. The old
man before mentioned, and two more, stood by these
things, inviting us, by signs, to land; but I had not
forgot the trap I was so near being caught in at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>last island; and this looked something like it. We
answered, by making signs for the two divisions to
retire farther back, and give us more room. The
old man seemed to desire them so to do, but no more
regard was paid to him than to us. More were continually
joining them, and, except two or three old
men, not one unarmed. In short, every thing conspired
to make us believe they meant to attack us as
soon as we should be on shore; the consequence of
which was easily supposed; many of them must have
been killed and wounded, and we should hardly have
escaped unhurt; two things I equally wished to prevent.
Since, therefore, they would not give us the
room we required, I thought it was better to frighten
them into it, than to oblige them by the deadly effect
of our fire-arms. I accordingly ordered a musket
to be fired over the party on our right, which was by
far the strongest body; but the alarm it gave them
was momentary. In an instant they recovered themselves,
and began to display their weapons. One
fellow showed us his backside, in a manner which
plainly conveyed his meaning. After this I ordered
three or four muskets to be fired. This was the
signal for the ship to fire a few great guns, which
presently dispersed them; and then we landed, and
marked out the limits, on the right and left, by a line.
Our old friend stood his ground, though deserted by
his two companions, and I rewarded his confidence
with a present. The natives came gradually to us,
seemingly in a more friendly manner; some even
without their weapons, but by far the greatest part
brought them; and when we made signs to lay them
down, they gave us to understand that we must lay
down ours first. Thus all parties stood armed. The
presents I made to the old people, and to such as
seemed to be of consequence, had little effect on
their conduct. They indeed climbed the cocoa-nut
trees, and threw us down the nuts, without requiring
any thing for them; but I took care that they should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>always have somewhat in return. I observed that
many were afraid to touch what belonged to us;
and they seemed to have no notion of exchanging
one thing for another. I took the old man, whose
name we now found to be Paowang, to the woods,
and made him understand, I wanted to cut down some
trees to take on board the ship; cutting some down
at the same time, which we put into one of our boats,
together with a few small casks of water, with a view
of letting the people see what it was we chiefly
wanted. Paowang very readily gave his consent to
cut wood; nor was there any one who made the least
objection. He only desired the cocoa-nut trees might
not be cut down. Matters being thus settled, we
embarked and returned on board to dinner, and, immediately
after, they all dispersed. I never learnt
that any one was hurt by our shot, either on this or
the preceding day; which was a very happy circumstance.
In the afternoon, having landed again,
we loaded the launch with water, and having
made three hauls with the seine, caught upwards of
three hundred pounds of mullet and other fish. It
was some time before any of the natives appeared,
and not above twenty or thirty at last, amongst whom
was our trusty friend Paowang, who made us a present
of a small pig, which was the only one we got
at this isle, or that was offered us.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the night, the volcano, which was about four
miles to the west of us, vomited up vast quantities of
fire and smoke, as it had also done the night before;
and the flames were seen to rise above the hill which
lay between us and it. At every eruption, it made
a long rumbling noise like that of thunder, or the
blowing up of large mines. A heavy shower of rain,
which fell at this time, seemed to increase it; and
the wind blowing from the same quarter, the air was
loaded with its ashes, which fell so thick, that every
thing was covered with the dust. It was a kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>fine sand or stone, ground or burnt to powder, and
was exceedingly troublesome to the eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the morning of the 7th, the natives began
again to assemble near the watering-place, armed
as usual, but not in such numbers as at first. After
breakfast we landed, in order to cut wood and fill
water. I found many of the islanders much inclined
to be friends with us, especially the old people; on
the other hand, most of the younger were daring
and insolent, and obliged us to keep to our arms. I
staid till I saw no disturbance was like to happen, and
then returned to the ship, leaving the party under
the command of Lieutenants Clerke and Edgcumbe.
When they came on board to dinner, they informed
me that the people continued to behave in the same
inconsistent manner as in the morning; but more especially
one man, whom Mr. Edgcumbe was obliged to
fire at, and believed he had struck with a swan-shot.
After that, the others behaved with more discretion;
and as soon as our people embarked, they all retired.
While we were sitting at dinner, an old man came on
board, looked into many parts of the ship, and then
went ashore again.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the afternoon, only a few of those who lived in
the neighbourhood, with whom we were now upon a
tolerable footing, made their appearance at the watering-place.
Paowang brought us an axe which had
been left by our people, either in the woods or on
the beach, and found by some of the natives. A few
other articles were afterwards returned to us, which
either they had stolen, or we had lost by our negligence.
So careful were they now not to offend us in
this respect.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early the next morning, I sent the launch, protected
by a party of marines in another boat, to take
in ballast, which we wanted. This work was done
before breakfast; and after it, she was sent for
wood and water, and with her the people employed
in this service under the protection of a serjeant’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>guard, which was now thought sufficient, as the natives
seemed to be pretty well reconciled to us. I
was told, that they asked our people to go home with
them, on condition they stripped naked as they were.
This shows that they had no design to rob them,
whatever other they might have.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 9th, I sent the launch for more ballast,
and the guard and wooders to the usual place. With
these I went myself, and found a good many
of the natives collected together, whose behaviour,
though armed, was courteous and obliging;
so that there was no longer any occasion to
mark out the limits by a line; they observed them
without this precaution. As it was necessary for
Mr. Wales’s instruments to remain on shore all the
middle of the day, the guard did not return to dinner,
as they had done before, till relieved by others.
When I came off, I prevailed on a young man, whose
name was Wha-a-gou, to accompany me. Before
dinner I showed him every part of the ship; but did
not observe that any one thing fixed his attention a
moment, or caused in him the least surprise. He
had no knowledge of goats, dogs, or cats, calling
them all hogs (<i>Booga</i> or <i>Boogas</i>). I made him a
present of a dog and a bitch, as he showed a liking
to that kind of animal. Soon after he came on
board, some of his friends followed in a canoe, and
enquired for him, probably doubtful of his safety.
He looked out of the quarter-gallery, and having
spoken to them, they went ashore, and quickly returned
with a cock, a little sugar-cane, and a few
cocoa-nuts, as a present to me. Though he sat
down with us, he did but just taste our salt pork,
but eat pretty heartily of yam, and drank a glass of
wine. After dinner I made him presents, and then
conducted him ashore.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as we landed, the youth and some of his
friends took me by the hand, with a view, as I understood,
to conduct me to their habitations. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>had not gone far, before some of them, for what
reason I know not, were unwilling I should proceed;
in consequence of which the whole company stopped;
and, if I was not mistaken, a person was dispatched
for something or other to give me; for I was desired
to sit down and wait, which I accordingly did. During
this interval, several of our gentlemen passed us,
at which they showed great uneasiness, and importuned
me so much to order them back, that I was at
last obliged to comply. They were jealous of our
going up the country, or even along the shore of the
harbour. While I was waiting here, our friend
Paowang came with a present of fruit and roots, carried
by about twenty men; in order, as I supposed,
to make it appear the greater. One had a small
bunch of plantains, another a yam, a third a cocoa-nut,
&amp;c.: but two men might have carried the whole
with ease. This present was in return for something
I had given him in the morning; however, I thought
the least I could do now, was to pay the porters.</p>

<p class='c000'>After I had dispatched Paowang, I returned to
Wha-a-gou and his friends, who were still for detaining
me. They seemed to wait with great impatience
for something, and to be unwilling and ashamed to
take away the two dogs, without making me a return.
As night was approaching, I pressed to be
gone; with which they complied, and so we parted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The preceding day, Mr. Forster learnt from the
people the proper name of the island, which they
call Tanna; and this day I learnt from them the
names of those in the neighbourhood. The one we
touched at last is called Erromango; the small isle,
which we discovered the morning we landed here,
Immer; the Table Island to the east, discovered at
the same time, Erronan or Foottoona; and an island
which lies to the S.&nbsp;E. Annattom. All these islands
are to be seen from Tanna.</p>

<p class='c000'>They gave us to understand, in a manner which I
thought admitted of no doubt, that they eat human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>flesh, and that circumcision was practised among
them. They began the subject of eating human flesh
of their own accord, by asking us if we did; otherwise
I should never have thought of asking them
such a question. I have heard people argue, that
no nation could be cannibals, if they had other
flesh to eat, or did not want food; thus deriving the
custom from necessity. The people of this island can
be under no such necessity; they have fine pork and
fowls, and plenty of roots and fruits. But since
we have not actually seen them eat human flesh, it
will admit of doubt with some, whether they are
cannibals.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I got on board, I learnt that, when the
launch was on the west side of the harbour taking in
ballast, one of the men employed on this work had
scalded his fingers in taking a stone up out of some
water. This circumstance produced the discovery
of several hot springs at the foot of the cliff, and
rather below high water mark.</p>

<p class='c000'>This day Mr. Wales and two or three of the
officers advanced a little, for the first time, into the
island. They met with a straggling village, the
inhabitants of which treated them with great civility;
and the next morning, Mr. Forster and his party, and
some others, made another excursion inland. They
met with several fine plantations of plantains, sugar-canes,
yams, &amp;c.; and the natives were courteous and
civil. Indeed, by this time, the people, especially
those in our neighbourhood, were so well reconciled
to us, that they showed not the least dislike at our
rambling about in the skirts of the woods, shooting,
&amp;c. In the afternoon, some boys having got behind
thickets, and having thrown two or three stones at
our people, who were cutting wood, they were fired
at by the petty officers present on duty. Being ashore
at the time, I was alarmed at hearing the report of
the muskets, and seeing two or three boys run out
of the wood. When I knew the cause, I was much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>displeased at so wanton an use being made of our fire-arms,
and took measures to prevent it for the future.
Wind southerly, with heavy showers of rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the night, and also all the 11th, the volcano
was exceedingly troublesome, and made a terrible
noise, throwing up prodigious columns of fire
and smoke at each explosion, which happened every
three or four minutes; and, at one time, great stones
were seen high in the air. Besides the necessary
work of wooding and watering, we struck the main-top-mast
to fix new trestle-trees and back-stays. Mr.
Forster and his party went up the hill on the west
side of the harbour, where he found three places
from whence smoke of a sulphureous smell issued,
through cracks or fissures in the earth. The ground
about these was exceedingly hot, and parched or
burnt, and they seemed to keep pace with the
volcano, for at every explosion of the latter, the quantity
of smoke or steam in these was greatly increased,
and forced out so as to rise in small columns, which
we saw from the ship, and had taken for common
fires made by the natives. At the foot of this hill
are the hot springs before mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the afternoon Mr. Forster, having begun his
botanical researches on the other side of the harbour,
fell in with our friend Paowang’s house, where he
saw most of the articles I had given him, hanging
on the adjoining trees and bushes, as if they were
not worthy of being under his roof.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 12th, some of the officers accompanied
Mr. Forster to the hot places he had been at the preceding
day. A thermometer placed in a little hole
made in one of them, rose from 80, at which it stood
in the open air, to 170. Several other parts of the
hill emitted smoke or steam all the day, and the
volcano was unusually furious, insomuch, that the
air was loaded with its ashes. The rain which fell at
this time, was a compound of water, sand, and earth;
so that it properly might be called showers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>mire. Whichever way the wind was, we were
plagued with the ashes; unless it blew very strong
indeed from the opposite direction. Notwithstanding
the natives seemed well enough satisfied with the few
expeditions we had made in the neighbourhood;
they were unwilling we should extend them farther.
As a proof of this, some undertook to guide the gentlemen
when they were in the country, to a place
where they might see the mouth of the volcano.
They very readily embraced the offer; and were conducted
down to the harbour, before they perceived
the cheat.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 13th, wind at N.&nbsp;E., gloomy weather. The
only thing worthy of note this day was, that Paowang
being at dinner with us on board, I took the
opportunity to show him several parts of the ship,
and various articles, in hopes of finding out something
which they might value, and be induced to
take from us in exchange for refreshments; for what
we got of this kind was trifling. But he looked on
every thing that was shown him with the utmost indifference;
nor did he take notice of any one thing
except a wooden sand-box, which he seemed to
admire, and turned two or three times over in his
hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning, after breakfast, a party of us set
out for the country, to try if we could not get a
nearer and better view of the volcano. We went by
the way of one of those hot smoking places before
mentioned, and dug a hole in the hottest part, into
which a thermometer of Fahrenheit’s construction
was put; and the mercury presently rose to 100°. It
remained in the hole two minutes and a half without
either rising or falling. The earth about this place
was a kind of white clay, had a sulphureous smell, and
was soft and wet, the surface only excepted, over
which was spread a thin dry crust, that had upon it
some sulphur, and a vitriolic substance, tasting like
alum. The place affected by the heat was not above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>eight or ten yards square; and near it were some fig-trees,
which spread their branches over a part of it,
and seemed to like their situation. We thought that
this extraordinary heat was caused by the steam of
boiling water, strongly impregnated with sulphur. I
was told that some of the other places were larger
than this; though we did not go out of the road to
look at them, but proceeded up the hill through a
country so covered with trees, shrubs, and plants,
that the bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees, which seem
to have been planted here by nature, were in a manner
choked up. Here and there we met with a
house, some few people, and plantations. These
latter we found in different states; some of long
standing; others lately cleared; and some only clearing,
and before any thing had been planted. The
clearing a piece of ground for a plantation seemed to
be a work of much labour, considering the tools they
had to work with, which, though much inferior to
those at the Society Isles, are of the same kind.
Their method is, however, judicious, and as expeditious
as it can well be. They lop off the small
branches of the large trees, dig under the roots, and
there burn the branches and small shrubs and plants
which they root up. The soil, in some parts, is a
rich black mould; in other parts, it seemed to be
composed of decayed vegetables, and of the ashes
the volcano sends forth throughout all its neighbourhood.
Happening to turn out of the common path,
we came into a plantation, where we found a man at
work, who, either out of good-nature, or to get us
the sooner out of his territories, undertook to be our
guide. We followed him accordingly, but had not
gone far before we came to the junction of two roads,
in one of which stood another man with a sling and a
stone, which he thought proper to lay down when a
musket was pointed at him. The attitude in which
we found him, the ferocity appearing in his looks,
and his behaviour after, convinced us that he meant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>to defend the path he stood in. He, in some measure,
gained his point; for our guide took the other road,
and we followed; but not without suspecting he was
leading us out of the common way. The other man
went with us likewise, counting us several times
over, and hallooing, as we judged, for assistance;
for we were presently joined by two or three more,
among whom was a young woman with a club in her
hand. By these people we were conducted to the
brow of a hill, and shown a road leading down to the
harbour, which they wanted us to take. Not choosing
to comply, we returned to that we had left,
which we pursued alone, our guide refusing to go
with us. After ascending another ridge, as thickly
covered with wood as those we had come over, we
saw yet other hills between us and the volcano,
which seemed as far off as at our first setting out.
This discouraged us from proceeding farther, especially
as we could get no one to be our guide. We
therefore came to a resolution to return; and had
but just put this in execution, when we met between
twenty and thirty people, whom the fellow before
mentioned had collected together, with a design, as
we judged, to oppose our advancing into the country;
but as they saw us returning, they suffered us to
pass unmolested. Some of them put us into the
right road, accompanied us down the hill, made us
stop by the way to entertain us with cocoa-nuts, plantains,
and sugar-cane; and what we did not eat on
the spot, they brought down the hill with us. Thus,
we found these people hospitable, civil, and good-natured,
when not prompted to a contrary conduct
by jealousy; a conduct I cannot tell how to blame
them for, especially when I consider the light in
which they must view us. It was impossible for
them to know our real design; we enter their ports
without their daring to oppose; we endeavour to
land in their country as friends, and it is well if this
succeeds; we land, nevertheless, and maintain the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>footing we have got, by the superiority of our fire-arms.
Under such circumstances, what opinion are
they to form of us? Is it not as reasonable for
them to think that we come to invade their country,
as to pay them a friendly visit? Time, and some acquaintance
with us, can only convince them of the
latter. These people are yet in a rude state; and,
if we may judge from circumstances and appearances,
are frequently at war, not only with their neighbours,
but among themselves; consequently must be jealous
of every new face. I will allow there are some
exceptions to this rule to be found in this sea; but
there are few nations who would willingly suffer
visitors like us to advance far into their country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before this excursion, some of us had been of
opinion, that these people were addicted to an unnatural
passion, because they had endeavoured to
entice some of our men into the woods; and, in
particular, I was told, that one who had the care of
Mr. Forster’s plant bag, had been, once or twice,
attempted. As the carrying of bundles, &amp;c. is the
office of the women in this country, it had occurred
to me, and I was not singular in this, that the natives
might mistake him, and some others, for women.
My conjecture was fully verified this day: for
this man, who was one of the party, and carried the
bag as usual, following me down the hill, by the
words which I understood of the conversation of the
natives, and by their actions, I was well assured that
they considered him as a female; till, by some means,
they discovered their mistake, on which they cried
out, <i>Erramange! Erramange!</i> It’s a man! It’s a man!
The thing was so palpable that every one was obliged
to acknowledge, that they had before mistaken his
sex; and that, after they were undeceived, they
seemed not to have the least notion of what we had
suspected. This circumstance will show how liable
we are to form wrong conjectures of things, among
people whose language we are ignorant of. Had it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>not been for this discovery, I make no doubt that
these people would have been charged with this vile
custom.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the evening I took a walk, with some of the
gentlemen, into the country on the other side of the
harbour, where we had very different treatment from
what we had met with in the morning. The people
we now visited, among whom was our friend Paowang,
being better acquainted with us, showed a readiness
to oblige us in every thing in their power. We came
to the village which had been visited on the 9th. It
consisted of about twenty houses, the most of which
need no other description than comparing them to
the roof of a thatched house in England taken off
the walls and placed on the ground. Some were
open at both ends; others partly closed with reeds;
and all were covered with palm thatch. A few of
them were thirty or forty feet long, and fourteen or
sixteen broad. Besides these, they have other mean
hovels, which, I conceived, were only to sleep in.
Some of these stood in a plantation, and I was given
to understand, that in one of them lay a dead corpse.
They made signs that described sleep, or death; and
circumstances pointed out the latter. Curious to see
all I could, I prevailed on an elderly man to go with
me to the hut, which was separated from the others
by a reed fence, built quite round it, at the distance of
four or five feet. The entrance was by a space in
the fence, made so low as to admit one to step over.
The two sides and one end of the hut were closed
or built up in the same manner, and with the same
materials, as the roof. The other end had been open,
but was now well closed up with mats, which I could
not prevail on the man to remove, or suffer me to do
it. There hung at this end of the hut a matted bag
or basket, in which was a piece of roasted yam, and
some sort of leaves, all quite fresh. I had a strong
desire to see the inside of the hut, but the man was
peremptory in refusing this, and even showed an unwillingness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>to permit me to look into the basket.
He wore round his neck, fastened to a string, two or
three locks of human hair; and a woman present had
several about her neck. I offered something in exchange
for them; but they gave me to understand
they could not part with them, as it was the hair of
the person who lay in the hut. Thus I was led to
believe, that these people dispose of their dead in a
manner similar to that of Otaheite. The same custom
of wearing the hair is observed by the people of
that island, and also by the New Zealanders. The
former make <i>Tamau</i> of the hair of their deceased
friends, and the latter make ear-rings and necklaces
of their teeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near most of their large houses were fixed upright
in the ground the stems of four cocoa-nut trees, in
a square position, about three feet from each other.
Some of our gentlemen, who first saw them, were
inclined to believe they were thus placed on a religious
account; but I was now satisfied that it was
for no other purpose but to hang cocoa-nuts on to
dry. For when I asked, as well as I could, the use
of them, a man took me to one, loaded with cocoa-nuts
from the bottom to the top; and no words
could have informed me better. Their situation is
well chosen for this use, as most of their large houses
are built in an open airy place, or where the wind
has a free passage, from whatever direction it blows.
Near most, if not all of them, is a large tree, or two,
whose spreading branches afford an agreeable retreat
from the scorching sun. This part of the island was
well cultivated, open and airy; the plantations were
laid out by line, abounding with plantains, sugar-canes,
yams, and other roots, and stocked with fruit trees.
In our walk we met with our old friend Paowang,
who, with some others, accompanied us to the water-side,
and brought with them, as a present, a few
yams and cocoa-nuts.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 15th, having finished wooding and watering,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>a few hands only were on shore making brooms, the rest
being employed on board, setting up the rigging, and
putting the ship in a condition for sea. Mr. Forster,
in his botanical excursion this day, shot a pigeon, in
the craw of which was a wild nutmeg. He took
some pains to find the tree, but his endeavours were
without success. In the evening a party of us walked
to the eastern sea-shore, in order to take the bearing of
Annattom, and Erronan or Foottoona. The horizon
proved so hazy that I could see neither; but one of
the natives gave me, as I afterwards found, the true
direction of them. We observed that in all, or most
of their sugar plantations, were dug holes or pits,
four feet deep, and five or six in diameter, and on
our inquiring their use, we were given to understand,
that they caught rats in them. These animals, which
are very destructive to the canes, are here in great
plenty. The canes, I observed, were planted as
thick as possible round the edge of these pits, so that
the rats in coming at them are the more liable to
tumble in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning we found the tiller sprung in the
rudder-head, and by some strange neglect, we had
not a spare one on board, which we were ignorant of
till now it was wanting. I knew but of one tree in the
neighbourhood fit for this purpose, which I sent the
carpenter on shore to look at, and an officer, with a
party of men, to cut it down, provided he could
obtain leave of the natives; if not, he was ordered to
acquaint me. He understood that no one had any
objection, and set the people to work accordingly.
But as the tree was large, this required some time;
and, before it was down, word was brought me that
our friend Paowang was not pleased. Upon this I
gave orders to desist, as we found that, by scarfing a
piece to the inner end of the tiller, and letting it
farther into the rudder-head, it would still perform
its office. But, as it was necessary to have a spare
one on board, I went on shore, sent for Paowang,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>made him a present of a dog and a piece of cloth,
and then explained to him that our great steering
paddle was broken, and that I wanted that tree to
make a new one. It was easy to see how well pleased
every one present was with the means I took to obtain
it. With one voice they gave their consent,
Paowang joining his also, which he perhaps could
not have done without the others; for I do not
know that he had either more property or more
authority than the rest. This point being obtained,
I took our friend on board to dinner, and after it
was over went with him on ashore, to pay a visit to
an old chief, who was said to be king of the island,
which was a doubt with me. Paowang took little or
no notice of him. I made him a present, after which
he immediately went away, as if he had got all he
came for. His name was Geogy, and they gave him
the title of <i>Areeke</i>. He was very old, but had a
merry open countenance. He wore round his waist
a broad red and white checquered belt, the materials
and manufacture of which seemed the same as that
of Otaheite cloth; but this was hardly a mark of distinction.
He had with him a son, not less than forty-five
or fifty years of age. A great number of people
were at this time at the landing-place; most of them
from distant parts. The behaviour of many was
friendly, while others were daring and insolent,
which I thought proper to put up with, as our stay
was nearly at an end.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 17th, about ten o’clock, I went ashore, and
found in the crowd old Geogy and his son, who soon
made me understand that they wanted to dine with
me; and accordingly I brought them, and two more
on board. They all called them <i>Areekees</i> (or kings);
but I doubt if any of them had the least pretensions
to that title over the whole island. It had been remarked
that one of these kings had not authority
enough to order one of the people up into a cocoa-nut
tree to bring him down some nuts. Although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>he spoke to several, he was at last obliged to go himself,
and by way of revenge, as it was thought, left
not a nut on the tree, taking what he wanted himself,
and giving the rest to some of our people.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I got them on board, I went with them all
over the ship, which they viewed with uncommon
surprise and attention. We happened to have for
their entertainment a kind of pie or pudding made
of plantains, and some sort of greens which we had
got from one of the natives. On this, and on yams,
they made a hearty dinner; for, as to the salt beef
and pork, they would hardly taste them. In the
afternoon, having made each of them a present of a
hatchet, a spike-nail, and some medals, I conducted
them ashore.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Forster and I then went over to the other side
of the harbour, and having tried, with Fahrenheit’s
thermometer, the head of one of the hot springs, we
found that the mercury rose to 191°. At this time
the tide was up within two or three feet of the spring,
so that we judged it might, in some degree, be
cooled by it. We were mistaken, however; for, on
repeating the experiment next morning, when the
tide was out, the mercury rose no higher than 187°;
but, at another spring, where the water bubbled out
of the sand from under the rock at the S.&nbsp;W. corner
of the harbour, the mercury, in the same thermometer,
rose to 202°
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>,</span>
which is but little colder than boiling
water. The hot places before mentioned are from
about three to four hundred feet perpendicular above
these springs, and on the slope of the same ridge
with the volcano; that is, there are no vallies between
them but such as are formed in the ridge itself; nor
is the volcano on the highest part of the ridge, but
on the S.&nbsp;E. side of it. This is, I have been told,
contrary to the general opinion of philosophers, who
say that volcanos must be on the summits of the
highest hills. So far is this from being the case on
this island, that some of its hills are more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>double the height of that on which the volcano is,
and close to it. To these remarks I must add, that,
in wet or moist weather, the volcano was most violent.
There seems to be room for some philosophical
reasoning on these phænomena of nature; but not
having any talent that way, I must content myself
with stating facts as I found them, and leave the
causes to men of more abilities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tiller was now finished; but as the wind was
unfavourable for sailing, the guard was sent on shore
on the 19th, as before, and a party of men to cut up
and bring off the remainder of the tree from which
we had got the tiller. Having nothing else to do,
I went on shore with them, and finding a good number
of the natives collected about the landing-place
as usual, I distributed among them all the articles I
had with me, and then went on board for more. In
less than an hour I returned, just as our people were
getting some large logs into the boat. At the same
time four or five of the natives stepped forward to see
what we were about, and as we did not allow them to
come within certain limits, unless to pass along the
<a id='beach2'></a>beach, the sentry ordered them back, which they
readily complied with. At this time, having my
eyes fixed on them, I observed the sentry present his
piece (as I thought at these men), and was just going
to reprove him for it, because I had observed that,
whenever this was done, some of the natives would
hold up their arms, to let us see they were equally
ready. But I was astonished beyond measure when
the sentry fired, for I saw not the least cause. At
this outrage most of the people fled: it was only a
few I could prevail on to remain. As they ran off,
I observed one man to fall; and he was immediately
lifted up by two others who took him into the water,
washed his wound, and then led him off. Presently
after, some came and described to me the nature of
his wound; and, as I found he was not carried far,
I sent for the surgeon. As soon as he arrived, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>went with him to the man, whom we found expiring.
The ball had struck his left arm, which was much
shattered, and then entered his body by the short-ribs,
one of which was broken. The rascal who
fired pretended that a man had laid an arrow across
his bow, and was going to shoot at him, so that he
apprehended himself in danger. But this was no
more than they had always done, and with no other
view than to show they were armed as well as we;
at least I have reason to think so, as they never went
farther. What made this incident the more unfortunate,
was, it not appearing to be the man who
bent the bow that was shot, but one who stood by
him. This affair threw the natives into the utmost
consternation; and the few that were prevailed on to
stay ran to the plantations and brought cocoa-nuts,
&amp;c. which they laid down at our feet. So soon were
these daring people humbled! When I went on board
to dinner they all retired, and only a few appeared
in the afternoon, amongst whom were Paowang and
Wha-a-gou. I had not seen this young man since
the day he dined on board. Both he and Paowang
promised to bring me fruit, &amp;c. the next morning,
but our early departure put it out of their power.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>During the night the wind had veered round to
S.&nbsp;E. As this was favourable for getting out of the
harbour, at four o’clock in the morning of the 20th,
we began to unmoor, and at eight, having weighed
our last anchor, put to sea. As soon as we were
clear of the land, I brought to, waiting for the launch
which was left behind to take up a kedge-anchor and
hawser we had out, to cast by. About day-break a
noise was heard in the woods, nearly abreast of us,
on the east side of the harbour, not unlike singing of
psalms. I was told that the like had been heard at the
same time every morning, but it never came to my
knowledge till now, when it was too late to learn the
occasion of it. Some were of opinion, that at the
east point of the harbour (where we observed, in
coming in, some houses, boats, &amp;c.) was something
sacred to religion, because some of our people had
attempted to go to this point, and were prevented by
the natives. I thought, and do still think, it was
only owing to a desire they showed, on every occasion,
of fixing bounds to our excursions. So far as
we had once been, we might go again; but not farther
with their consent. But by encroaching a little
every time, our country expeditions were insensibly
extended without giving the least umbrage. Besides,
these morning ceremonies, whether religious or not,
were not performed down at that point, but in a part
where some of our people had been daily.</p>

<p class='c000'>I cannot say what might be the true cause of these
people showing such dislike to our going up into their
country. It might be owing to a naturally jealous
disposition, or perhaps to their being accustomed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>hostile visits from their neighbours, or quarrels among
themselves. Circumstances seemed to show that such
must frequently happen; for we observed them very
expert in arms, and well accustomed to them; seldom
or never travelling without them. It is possible all
this might be on our account; but I hardly think it.
We never gave them the least molestation, nor did
we touch any part of their property, not even the
wood and water, without first having obtained their
consent. The very cocoa-nuts, hanging over the
heads of the workmen, were as safe as those in the
middle of the island. It happened, rather fortunately,
that there were so many cocoa-nut trees near the
skirts of the harbour, which seemed not to be private
property; so that we could generally prevail on
the natives to bring us some of these nuts, when
nothing would induce them to bring any out of the
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were not wholly without refreshments; for
besides the fish, which our seine now and then provided
us with, we procured daily some fruits or roots
from the natives, though but little in proportion
to what we could consume. The reason why we
got no more might be our having nothing to give
them in exchange, which they thought valuable.
They had not the least knowledge of iron; consequently,
nails and iron tools, beads, &amp;c. which had
so great a run at the more eastern isles, were of no
consideration here; and cloth can be of no use to
people who go naked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The produce of this island is bread-fruit, plantains,
cocoa-nuts, a fruit like a nectarine, yams, terra, a
sort of potatoe, sugar-cane, wild figs, a fruit like an
orange, which is not eatable, and some other fruit
and nuts whose names I have not. Nor have I any
doubt that the nutmeg before mentioned was the produce
of this island. The bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and
plantains, are neither so plentiful nor so good as at
Otaheite; on the other hand, sugar-canes and yams
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>are not only in greater plenty, but of superior quality,
and much larger. We got one of the latter
which weighed fifty-six pounds, every ounce of which
was good. Hogs did not seem to be scarce; but we
saw not many fowls. These are the only domestic
animals they have. Land birds are not more numerous
than at Otaheite, and the other islands; but we
met with some small birds, with a very beautiful
plumage, which we had never seen before. There is
as great a variety of trees and plants here as at any
island we touched at, where our botanists had time
to examine. I believe these people live chiefly on
the produce of the land, and that the sea contributes
but little to their subsistence. Whether this arises
from the coast not abounding with fish, or from their
being bad fishermen, I know not; both causes perhaps
concur. I never saw any sort of fishing-tackle
amongst them, nor any one out fishing, except on the
shoals, or along the shores of the harbour, where
they would watch to strike with a dart such fish as
came within their reach; and in this they were expert.
They seemed much to admire our catching fish
with the seine; and, I believe, were not well pleased
with it at last. I doubt not they have other methods
of catching fish besides striking them.</p>

<p class='c000'>We understood that the little isle of Immer was
chiefly inhabited by fishermen, and that the canoes
we frequently saw pass, to and from that isle and
the east point of the harbour, were fishing canoes.
These canoes were of unequal sizes, some thirty feet
long, two broad, and three deep, and they are composed
of several pieces of wood clumsily sewed together
with bandages. The joints are covered on the
outside by a thin batten champhered off at the edges,
over which the bandages pass. They are navigated
either by paddles or sails. The sail is latteen, extended
to a yard and boom, and hoisted to a short
mast. Some of the large canoes have two sails, and
all of them outriggers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>At first we thought the people of this island, as
well as those of Erromango, were a race between the
natives of the Friendly Islands and those of Mallicollo;
but a little acquaintance with them convinced
us that they had little or no affinity to either, except
it be in their hair, which is much like what the people
of the latter island have. The general colours of it
are black and brown, growing to a tolerable length,
and very crisp and curly. They separate it into small
locks, which they woold or cue round with the rind
of a slender plant, down to about an inch of the
ends; and, as the hair grows, the woolding is continued.
Each of these cues or locks is somewhat thicker
than common whipcord; and they look like a parcel
of small strings hanging down from the crown of their
heads. Their beards, which are strong and bushy,
are generally short. The women do not wear their
hair so, but cropped; nor do the boys, till they approach
manhood. Some few men, women, and children,
were seen, who had hair like ours; but it was
obvious that these were of another nation; and I
think we understood they came from Erronan. It
is to this island they ascribe one of the two languages
which they speak, and which is nearly, if not exactly,
the same as that spoken at the Friendly Isles.
It is therefore more than probable that Erronan was
peopled from that nation, and that, by long intercourse
with Tanna and the other neighbouring islands,
each hath learnt the other’s language, which they use
indiscriminately.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other language which the people of Tanna
speak, and, as we understood, those of Erromango
and Annattom, is properly their own. It is different
from any we had before met with, and bears no affinity
to that of Mallicollo; so that, it should seem,
the people of these islands are a distinct nation of
themselves. Mallicollo, Apee, &amp;c. were names entirely
unknown to them; they even knew nothing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Sandwich Island, which is much the nearer. I took
no small pains to know how far their geographical
knowledge extended; and did not find that it exceeded
the limits of their horizon.</p>

<p class='c000'>These people are of the middle size, rather slender
than otherwise; many are little, but few tall or stout;
the most of them have good features, and agreeable
countenances; are, like all the tropical race, active
and nimble; and seem to excel in the use of arms,
but not to be fond of labour. They never would put
a hand to assist in any work we were carrying on,
which the people of the other islands used to delight
in. But what I judge most from, is their making
the females do the most laborious work, as if they
were pack-horses. I have seen a woman carrying a
large bundle on her back, or a child on her back and
a bundle under her arm, and a fellow strutting before
her with nothing but a club or spear, or some such
thing. We have frequently observed little troops of
women pass, to and fro, along the beach, laden with
fruit and roots, escorted by a party of men under
arms; though, now and then, we have seen a man
carry a burden at the same time, but not often. I
know not on what account this was done, nor that an
armed troop was necessary. At first, we thought
they were moving out of the neighbourhood with their
effects; but we afterwards saw them both carry out
and bring in every day.</p>

<p class='c000'>I cannot say the women are beauties; but I think
them handsome enough for the men, and too handsome
for the use that is made of them. Both sexes
are of a very dark colour, but not black; nor have
they the least characteristic of the negro about them.
They make themselves blacker than they really are,
by painting their faces with a pigment of the colour
of black lead. They also use another sort which is
red, and a third sort brown, or a colour between red
and black. All these, but especially the first, they
lay on, with a liberal hand, not only on the face, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>on the neck, shoulders, and breast. The men wear
nothing but a belt, and the wrapping leaf as at Mallicollo.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c009'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
The women have a kind of petticoat made
of the filaments of the plantain tree, flags, or some
such thing, which reaches below the knee. Both
sexes wear ornaments, such as bracelets, ear-rings,
necklaces, and amulets. The bracelets are chiefly
worn by the men; some made of sea-shells, and
others of those of the cocoa-nut. The men also
wear amulets; and those of most value being made
of a greenish stone, the green stone of New Zealand
is valued by them for this purpose. Necklaces are
chiefly used by the women, and made mostly of shells.
Ear-rings are common to both sexes, and those valued
most are made of tortoise-shell. Some of our
people having got some at the Friendly Islands,
brought it to a good market here, where it was of
more value than any thing we had besides; from
which I conclude that these people catch but few
turtle, though I saw one in the harbour, just as we
were getting under sail. I observed that, towards
the latter end of our stay, they began to ask for
hatchets, and large nails; so that it is likely they
had found that iron is more serviceable than <a id='stone'></a>stone,
or shells, of which all their tools I have
seen are made. Their stone hatchets, at least all
those I saw, are not in the shape of
adzes, as at the other islands, but
more like an axe, in this form.
<a href="images/i_081.jpg"><img src="images/i_081.jpg"
style="width:300px;" alt="Illustration of axe" /></a>
In the helve, which is pretty thick, is made a hole
into which the stone is fixed.</p>

<p class='c000'>These people, besides the cultivation of ground,
have few other arts worth mentioning. They
know how to make a coarse kind of matting, and a
coarse cloth of the bark of a tree, which is used
chiefly for belts. The workmanship of their canoes, I
have before observed, is very rude; and their arms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>with which they take the most pains in point
of neatness, come far short of some others we had
seen. Their weapons are clubs, spears, or darts,
bows and arrows, and stones. The clubs are of
three or four kinds, and from three to five feet
long. They seem to place most dependence on the
darts, which are pointed with three bearded edges.
In throwing them they make use of a becket, that is,
a piece of stiff plaited cord about six inches long,
with an eye in one end and a knot at the other.
The eye is fixed on the fore-finger of the right hand,
and the other end is hitched round the dart, where
it is nearly on an equipoise. They hold the dart between
the thumb and remaining fingers, which serve
only to give it direction, the velocity being communicated
by the becket and fore-finger. The former
flies off from the dart the instant its velocity becomes
greater than that of the hand, but it remains on the
finger ready to be used again. With darts they kill
both birds and fish, and are sure of hitting a mark,
within the compass of the crown of a hat, at the distance
of eight or ten yards; but, at double that distance,
it is chance if they hit a mark the size of a
man’s body, though they will throw the weapon
sixty or seventy yards. They always throw with all
their might, let the distance be what it will. Darts,
bows and arrows, are to them what muskets are to
us. The arrows are made of reeds pointed with hard
wood: some are bearded and some not, and those
for shooting birds have two, three, and sometimes
four points. The stones they use are, in general,
the branches of coral rocks from eight to fourteen
inches long, and from an inch to an inch and a half in
diameter. I know not if they employ them as missive
weapons; almost every one of them carries a club,
and besides that, either darts, or a bow and arrows,
but never both: those who had stones kept them generally
in their belts.</p>

<p class='c000'>I cannot conclude this account of their arms without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>adding an entire passage out of Mr. Wales’s journal.
As this gentleman was continually on shore
amongst them, he had a better opportunity of seeing
what they could perform than any of us. The passage
is as follows: “I must confess I have been often
led to think the feats which Homer represents his
heroes as performing with their spears a little too
much of the marvellous to be admitted into an
heroic poem; I mean when confined within the
streight stays of Aristotle. Nay, even so great
an advocate for him as Mr. Pope acknowledges
them to be <em>surprising</em>. But since I have seen
what these people can do with their wooden spears,
and them badly pointed, and not of a very hard
nature, I have not the least exception to any
one passage in that great poet on this account.
But, if I see fewer exceptions, I can find infinitely
more beauties in him; as he has, I think, scarce
an action, circumstance, or description of any
kind whatever, relating to a spear, which I have
not seen and recognised among these people; as
their whirling motion, and whistling noise, as they
fly; their quivering motion, as they stick in the
ground when they fall; their meditating their aim,
when they are going to throw; and their shaking
them in their hand as they go along, &amp;c. &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I know no more of their cookery, than that it consists
of roasting and baking; for they have no vessel
in which water can be boiled. Nor do I know that
they have any other liquor but water and the juice
of the cocoa-nut.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are utter strangers to their religion; and but
little acquainted with their government. They seem
to have chiefs among them; at least some were
pointed out to us by that title; but, as I before observed,
they appeared to have very little authority
over the rest of the people. Old Geogy was the
only one the people were ever seen to take the least
notice of; but whether this was owing to high rank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>or old age I cannot say. On several occasions I
have seen the old men respected and obeyed. Our
friend Paowang was so; and yet I never heard him
called chief, and have many reasons to believe that
he had not a right to any more authority than many
of his neighbours, and few, if any, were bound to
obey him, or any other person in our neighbourhood;
for if there had been such a one, we certainly
should, by some means, have known it. I named
the harbour Port Resolution, after the ship, she
being the first which ever entered it. It is situated
on the north side of the most eastern point of
the island, and about E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. from the volcano; in
the latitude of 19° 32ʹ 25ʺ
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
South, and in the longitude
of 169° 44ʹ 35ʺ East. It is no more than a little
creek running in S. by W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W. three quarters of a
mile, and is about half that in breadth. A shoal of sand
and rocks lying on the east side makes it still narrower.
The depth of water in the harbour is from
six to three fathoms, and the bottom is sand and mud.
No place can be more convenient for taking in wood
and water; for both are close to the shore. The
water stunk a little after it had been a few days on
board, but it afterwards turned sweet; and, even
when it was at the worst, the tin machine would, in
a few hours, recover a whole cask. This is an excellent
contrivance for sweetening water at sea, and
is well known in the navy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Wales, from whom I had the latitude and
longitude, found the variation of the needle to be
7° 14ʹ 12ʺ East, and the dip of its south end 45°
<span class='nobreak'>2<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>ʹ.</span>
He also observed the time of high water, on the full
and change days; to be about 5 h. 45m., and the tide to
rise and fall three feet.</p>

  <h2 id='b3c7' class='c004'>CHAP. VII.<br /> <br />THE SURVEY OF THE ISLANDS CONTINUED, AND A MORE PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF THEM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>As soon as the boats were hoisted in, we made sail,
and stretched to the eastward, with a fresh gale at
S.&nbsp;E., in order to have a nearer view of Erronan, and
to see if there was any land in its neighbourhood.
We stood on till midnight, when, having passed the
island, we tacked, and spent the remainder of the
night making two boards. At sunrise on the 21st,
we stood to S.&nbsp;W. in order to get to the south of
Tanna, and nearer to Annattom, to observe if any
more land lay in that direction; for an extraordinary
clear morning had produced no discovery of any
to the east. At noon having observed in latitude
20° 33ʹ 30ʺ, the situation of the lands around us was
as follows. Port Resolution bore 86° West, distant
six and a half leagues; the island of Tanna extended
from S. 88° West, to N. 64° West; Traitor’s Head
N. 58° West, distant twenty leagues; the island of
Erronan N. 86° East, distant five leagues; and
Annattom from S.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E. to S
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W. distant ten
leagues. We continued to stretch to the south till two
o’clock P.&nbsp;M. when, seeing no more land before us,
we bore up round the S.&nbsp;E. end of Tanna; and, with
a fine gale at E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. ran along the south coast at
one league from shore. It seemed a bold one, without
the guard of any rocks; and the country full as
fertile as in the neighbourhood of the harbour, and
making a fine appearance. At six o’clock the high
land of Erromango appeared over the west end of
Tanna in the direction of N. 16° West; at eight
o’clock we were past the island, and steered N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W.
for Sandwich Island, in order to finish the survey<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c009'><sup>[7]</sup></a> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>it, and of the isles to the N.&nbsp;W. On the 22d, at four
o’clock P.&nbsp;M., we drew near the S.&nbsp;E. end, and ranging
the south coast, found it to trend in the direction
of West and W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. for about nine leagues. Near
the middle of this length, and close to the shore, are
three or four small isles, behind which seemed to be
a safe anchorage. But not thinking I had any time
to spare to visit this fine island, I continued to range
the coast to its western extremity, and then steered
N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. for the S.&nbsp;E. end of Mallicollo, which, at
half past six o’clock next morning, bore N. 14° East,
distant seven or eight leagues, and Three-Hills Island
S. 82° East. Soon after, we saw the islands Apee,
Paoom, and Ambrym. What we had comprehended
under the name of Paoom appeared now to be two
isles, something like a separation being seen between
the hill and the land to the west of it. We approached
the S.&nbsp;W. side of Mallicollo to within half
a league, and ranged it at that distance. From the
S.&nbsp;E. point, the direction of the land is west, a little
southerly, for six or seven leagues, and then N.&nbsp;W. by
W. three leagues, to a pretty high point or head-land,
situated in latitude 16° 29ʹ, and which obtained the
name of South-West Cape. The coast, which is low,
seemed to be indented into creeks and projecting
points; or else, these points were small isles lying
under the shore. We were sure of one, which lies
between two and three leagues east of the Cape.
Close to the west side or point of the Cape lies, connected
with it by breakers, a round rock or islet,
which helps to shelter a fine bay, formed by an elbow
in the coast, from the reigning winds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The natives appeared in troops on many parts
of the shore, and some seemed desirous to come
off to us in canoes; but they did not; and, probably,
our not shortening sail was the reason. From
the South-West Cape, the direction of the coast is
N. by W., but the most advanced land bore from
it N.&nbsp;W. by N. at which the land seemed to
terminate. Continuing to follow the direction of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the coast, at noon it was two miles from us;
and our latitude, by observation, was 16° 22ʹ 30ʺ
South. This is nearly the parallel to Port Sandwich,
and our never-failing guide, the watch, showed that
we were 26ʹ W. of it; a distance which the breadth of
Mallicollo cannot exceed in this parallel. The South-West
Cape bore S. 26° East, distant seven miles; and
the most advanced point of land, for which we steered,
bore N.&nbsp;W. by N. At three o’clock, we were the
length of it, and found the land continued, and trending
more and more to the north. We coasted it to
its northern extremity, which we did not reach till
after dark, at which time we were near enough the
shore to hear the voices of people, who were assembled
round a fire they had made on the beach.
There we sounded, and found twenty fathoms and a
bottom of sand; but, on edging off from the shore,
we soon got out of sounding, and then made a trip
back to the south till the moon got up. After this we
stood again to the north, hauled round the point,
and spent the night in Bougainville’s passage; being
assured of our situation before sunset, by seeing the
land, on the north side of the passage, extending as
far as N.&nbsp;W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W.</p>

<p class='c000'>The south coast of Mallicollo, from the S.&nbsp;E. end
to the S.&nbsp;W. Cape, is luxuriantly clothed with wood,
and other productions of nature, from the sea-shore
to the very summits of the hills. To the N.&nbsp;W. of
the Cape the country is less woody, but more agreeably
interspersed with lawns, some of which appeared
to be cultivated. The summits of the hills seemed
barren; and the highest lies between Port Sandwich
and the S.&nbsp;W. Cape. Farther north, the land falls insensibly
lower, and is less covered with wood. I
believe it is a very fertile island, and well inhabited;
for we saw smoke by day, and fire by night, in all
parts of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning at sunrise, we found ourselves
nearly in the middle of the passage, the N.&nbsp;W. end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>of Mallicollo extending from S. 30° East, to S. 58°
West; the land to the north from N. 70° West, to N.
4° East; and the Isle of Lepers bearing N. 30° East,
distant eleven or twelve leagues. We now made sail,
and steered N. by E., and afterwards north, along the
east coast of the northern land, with a fine breeze at
S.&nbsp;E. We found that this coast, which at first appeared
to be continued, was composed of several low
woody isles, the most of them of small extent, except
the southernmost, which, on account of the day,
I named St. Bartholomew. It is six or seven leagues
in circuit, and makes the N.&nbsp;E. point of Bougainville’s
Passage. At noon the breeze began to slacken. We
were, at this time, between two and three miles from
the land, and observed, in latitude 15° 23ʹ, the Isle
of Lepers bearing from E. by N. to E. by S., distant
seven leagues; and an high bluff-head, at which the
coast we were upon seemed to terminate, N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W., distant ten or eleven leagues; but from the mast-head
we could see land to the east. This we judged
to be an island, and it bore N. by W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we advanced to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. along a fine coast,
covered with woods, we perceived low land that extended
off from the bluff-head towards the island
above mentioned, but did not seem to join it. It
was my intention to have gone through the channel,
but the approach of night made me lay it aside, and
steer without the island. During the afternoon we
passed some small isles lying under the shore; and
observed some projecting points of unequal height,
but were not able to determine whether or no they
were connected with the main land. Behind them
was a ridge of hills which terminated at the bluff-head.
There were cliffs, in some places of the coast,
and white patches, which we judged to be chalk. At
ten o’clock, being the length of the isle which lies
off the head, we shortened sail, and spent the night
making short boards.</p>

<p class='c000'>At day-break, on the 25th, we were on the north
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>side of the island (which is of a moderate height,
and three leagues in circuit), and steered west for
the bluff-head along the low land under it. At sun-rise
an elevated coast came in sight beyond the bluff-head,
extending to the north as far as N.&nbsp;W. by W.
After doubling the head we found the land to trend
south, a little easterly, and to form a large, deep bay,
bounded on the west by the coast just mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every thing conspired to make us believe this was
the bay of St. Philip and St. Jago, discovered by
Quiros in 1606. To determine this point it was necessary
to proceed farther up; for at this time we
saw no end to it. The wind being at south, we were
obliged to ply, and first stretched over for the west
shore, from which we were three miles at noon, when
our latitude was 14° 55ʹ 30ʺ South, longitude 167° 3ʹ
East; the mouth of the bay extending from N. 64°
West to S. 86° East, which last direction was the
bluff-head, distant three leagues. In the afternoon,
the wind veering to E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., we could look up to the
head of the bay; but as the breeze was faint, a N.&nbsp;E. swell hurled us over to the west shore; so that,
at half past four o’clock P. M, we were no more than
two miles from it, and tacked in one hundred and
twenty fathoms water, a soft muddy bottom. The
bluff-head, or east point of the bay, bore N. 53° East.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had no sooner tacked than it fell calm, and we
were left to the mercy of the swell, which continued
to hurtle us towards the shore, where large troops of
people <a id='were'></a>were assembled. Some ventured off in two
canoes; but all the signs of friendship we could make,
did not induce them to come along-side, or near
enough to receive any present from us. At last they
took sudden fright at something, and returned ashore.
They were naked, except having some long grass,
like flags, fastened to a belt, and hanging down before
and behind, nearly as low as the knee. Their
colour was very dark, and their hair woolly; or cut
short, which made it seem so. The canoes were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>small, and had out-riggers. The calm continued till
near eight o’clock, in which time we drove into eighty-five
fathoms water, and so near the shore, that I expected
we should be obliged to anchor. A breeze of
wind sprung up at E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., and first took us on the
wrong side; but, contrary to all our expectations,
and when we had hardly room to veer, the ship came
about, and having filled on the starboard tack, we
stood off N.&nbsp;E. Thus we were relieved from the
apprehensions of being forced to anchor in a great
depth, on a lee shore, and in a dark and obscure
night.</p>

<p class='c000'>We continued to ply upwards, with variable
light breezes between E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. and S., till ten next
morning, when it fell calm. We were, at this time,
about seven or eight miles from the head of the bay,
which is terminated by a low beach; and behind that
is an extensive flat covered with wood, and bounded
on each side by a ridge of mountains. At noon we
found the latitude to be 15° 5ʹ South, and were detained
here by the calm till one o’clock P.&nbsp;M., when
we got a breeze at N. by W., with which we steered
up to within two miles of the head of the bay; and
then I sent Mr. Cooper and Mr. Gilbert to sound
and reconnoitre the coast, while we stood to and fro
with the ship. This gave time to three sailing canoes,
which had been following us some time, to
come up. There were five or six men in each; and
they approached near enough to receive such things
as were thrown to them fastened to a rope, but would
not advance along-side. They were the same sort of
people as those we had seen the preceding evening;
indeed we thought they came from the same place.
They seemed to be stouter and better shaped men
than those of Mallicollo; and several circumstances
concurred to make us think they were of another
nation. They named the numerals as far as five or
six, in the language of Anamocka, and understood
us when we asked the names of the adjacent lands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>in that language. Some, indeed, had black short
frizzled hair, like the natives of Mallicollo; but
others had it long, tied up on the crown of the head,
and ornamented with feathers, like the New Zealanders.
Their other ornaments were bracelets and
necklaces; one man had something like a white
shell on his forehead; and some were painted with a
blackish pigment. I did not see that they had any
other weapon but darts and gigs, intended only for
striking of fish. Their canoes were much like those
of Tanna, and navigated in the same manner, or
nearly so. They readily gave us the names of such
parts as we pointed to: but we could not obtain from
them the name of the island. At length, seeing our
boats coming, they paddled in for the shore, notwithstanding
all we could say or do to detain them.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the boats returned, Mr. Cooper informed
me, that they had landed on the beach which is at
the head of the bay, near a fine river, or stream of
fresh water, so large and deep, that they judged
boats might enter it at high water. They found three
fathoms depth close to the beach, and fifty-five and
fifty, two cables’ length off. Farther out they did
not sound; and where we were with the ship we had
no soundings with an hundred and seventy fathoms
line. Before the boats got on board, the wind had
shifted to S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. As we were in want of nothing,
and had no time to spare, I took the advantage of
this shift of wind, and steered down the bay. During
the fore-part of the night, the country was illuminated
with fires, from the sea-shore to the summits
of the mountains; but this was only on the west side
of the shore. I cannot pretend to say what was the
occasion of these fires, but have no idea of their
being on our account. Probably they were burning
or clearing the ground for new plantations. At day-break,
on the 27th, we found ourselves two-thirds
down the bay; and, as we had but little wind, it
was noon before we were the length of the N.&nbsp;W.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>point, which at this time bore N. 82° West, distant
five miles. Latitude observed, 14° 39ʹ 30ʺ.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of our gentlemen were doubtful of this being
the bay of St. Philip and St. Jago, as there was no
place which they thought could mean the port of
Vera Cruz. For my part, I found general points to
agree so well with Quiros’s description, that I had not
the least doubt about it. As to what he calls the port
of Vera Cruz, I understand that to be the anchorage
at the head of the bay, which in some places may
extend farther off than where our boats landed. There
is nothing in his account of the port which contradicts
this supposition.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c009'><sup>[8]</sup></a> It was but natural for his
people to give a name to the place, independent of
so large a bay, where they lay so long at anchor. A
port is a vague term, like many others in geography,
and has been very often applied to places far less sheltered
than this.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our officers observed that grass and other plants
grew on the beach close to high-water mark; which
is always a sure sign of pacific anchorage, and an undeniable
proof that there never is a great surf on the
shore. They judged that the tide rose about four or
five feet, and that boats and such craft might, at
high water, enter the river, which seemed to be pretty
deep and broad within; so that this, probably, is one
of those mentioned by Quiros; and, if we were not
deceived, we saw the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bay hath twenty leagues sea-coast; six on the
east side, which lies in the direction of S.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
West
and N.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
East; two at the head, and twelve on
the west side, the direction of which is S. by E. and
N. by W. from the head down to two-thirds of its
length, and then N.&nbsp;W. by N. to the N.&nbsp;W. point.
The two points which form the entrance lie in the
direction of S. 53° East, and N. 53° West, from each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>other distant ten leagues. The bay is every where
free from danger, and of unfathomable depth, except
near the shores, which are for the most part
low. This, however, is only a very narrow strip between
the sea-shore and the foot of the hills; for the
bay, as well as the flat land at the head of it, is
bounded on each side by a ridge of hills, one of which,
that to the west, is very high and double, extending
the whole length of the island. An uncommonly
luxuriant vegetation was every where to be seen;
the sides of the hills were chequered with plantations,
and every valley watered by a stream. Of all the
productions of nature this country was adorned with,
the cocoa-nut trees were the most conspicuous. The
columns of smoke we saw by day, and the fires by
night, all over the country, led us to believe that it is
well inhabited and very fertile. The east point of this
bay, which I name Cape Quiros, in memory of its first
discoverer, is situated in latitude 14° 56ʹ South, longitude
167° 13ʹ East. The N.&nbsp;W. point, which I
named Cape Cumberland, in honour of his Royal
Highness the Duke, lies in the latitude of 14° 38ʹ
45ʺ South, longitude 166°
<span class='nobreak'>49<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>ʹ</span>
East, and is the
N.&nbsp;W. extremity of this archipelago; for, after
doubling it, we found the coast to trend gradually
round to the S. and S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 28th and 29th we had light airs and calms,
so that we advanced but little. In this time we took
every opportunity, when the horizon was clearer
than usual, to look out for more land; but none was
seen. By Quiros’s track to the north, after leaving
the bay above mentioned, it seems probable that there
is none nearer than Queen Charlotte’s Island, discovered
by Captain Carteret, which lies about ninety
leagues N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. from Cape Cumberland, and I take
to be the same with Quiros’s Santa Cruz.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 30th the calm was succeeded by a fresh
breeze at S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., which enabled us to ply up the coast.
At noon we observed in 15° 20ʹ; afterwards we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>stretched in east, to within a mile of the shore, and
then tacked, in seventy-five fathoms, before a sandy
flat, on which several of the natives made their appearance.
We observed, on the sides of the hills,
several plantations that were laid out by line, and
fenced round.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 31st, at noon, the S. or S.&nbsp;W. point of
the island bore N. 62° East, distant four leagues.
This forms the N.&nbsp;W. point of what I call Bougainville’s
Passage; the N.&nbsp;E. point, at this time, bore
N. 85° East, and the N.&nbsp;W. end of Mollicollo from
S. 54° East to S. 72° East. Latitude observed, 15°
45ʹ S. In the afternoon, in stretching to the east,
we weathered the S.&nbsp;W. point of the island, from
which the coast trends east northerly. It is low,
and seemed to form some creeks or coves; and, as
we got farther into the passage, we perceived some
small low isles lying along it, which seemed to extend
behind St. Bartholomew Island.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having now finished the survey of the whole archipelago,
the season of the year made it necessary
for me to return to the south, while I had yet some
time left to explore any land I might meet with between
this and New Zealand; where I intended to touch,
that I might refresh my people, and recruit our stock
of wood and water for another southern course. With
this view, at five P.&nbsp;M. we tacked, and hauled to the
southward, with a fresh gale at S.&nbsp;E. At this time
the N.&nbsp;W. point of the passage, or the S.&nbsp;W. point
of the island Tierra del Espiritu Santo, the only remains
of Quiros’s continent, bore N. 82° West, distant
three leagues. I named it Cape Lisburne, and
its situation is in latitude 15° 40ʹ, longitude 165° 59ʹ
East.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing account of these islands, in the order
in which we explored them, not being particular
enough either as to situation or description, it may
not be improper now to give a more accurate view of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>them, which, with the annexed chart, will convey to
the reader a better idea of the whole group.</p>

<p class='c000'>The northern islands of this archipelago were first
discovered by that great navigator, Quiros, in 1606;
and, not without reason, were considered as part of
the southern continent, which, at that time, and until
very lately, was supposed to exist. They were
next visited by M. de Bougainville, in 1768; who,
besides landing on the Isle of Lepers, did no more
than discover that the land was not connected, but
composed of islands, which he called the Great Cyclades.
But as, besides ascertaining the extent and
situation of these islands, we added to them several
new ones which were not known before, and explored
the whole, I think we have obtained a right
to name them; and shall in future distinguish them
by the name of the New Hebrides. They are situated
between the latitude of 14° 29ʹ and 20° 4ʹ South,
and between 166° 41ʹ and 170° 21ʹ East longitude,
and extend an hundred and twenty-five leagues in the
direction of N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
West, and S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
East.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most northern island is that called by M. de
Bougainville Peak of the Etoile. It is situated, according
to his account, in latitude 14° 29ʹ, longitude
168° 9ʹ; and, N. by W., eight leagues from Aurora.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next island, which lies farthest north, is that
of Tierra del Espiritu Santo. It is the most western
and largest of all the Hebrides, being twenty-two
leagues long, in the direction of N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
West,
and S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
East, twelve in breadth, and sixty in
circuit. We have obtained the true figure of this
island very accurately. The land of it, especially
the west side, is exceedingly high and mountainous;
and, in many places, the hills rise directly from the
sea. Except the cliffs and beaches, every other part
is covered with wood, or laid out in plantations.
Besides the bay of St. Philip and St. Jago, the isles
which lie along the south and east coast, cannot, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>my opinion, fail of forming some good bays or harbours.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next considerable island is that of Mallicollo,
to the S.&nbsp;E. It extends N.&nbsp;W. and S.&nbsp;E., and is
eighteen leagues long in that direction. Its greatest
breadth, which is at the S.&nbsp;E. end, is eight leagues.
The N.&nbsp;W. end is two-thirds this breadth; and
nearer the middle, one-third. This contraction is
occasioned by a wide and pretty deep bay on the
S.&nbsp;W. side. To judge of this island from what we
saw of it, it must be very fertile and well inhabited.
The land on the sea-coast is rather low, and lies with
a gentle slope from the hills which are in the middle
of the island. Two-thirds of the N.&nbsp;E. coast was only
seen at a great distance; therefore the delineations of
it on the chart can have no pretensions to accuracy;
but the other parts, I apprehend, are without any
material errors.</p>

<p class='c000'>St. Bartholomew lies between the S.&nbsp;E. end of
Tierra del Espiritu Santo, and the north end of
Mallicollo; and the distance between it and the latter
is eight miles. This is the passage through which
M. de Bougainville went; and the middle of it is in
latitude 15° 48ʹ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Isle of Lepers lies between Espiritu Santo and
Aurora Island, eight leagues from the former, and
three from the latter, in latitude 15° 22ʹ, and nearly
under the same meridian as the S.&nbsp;E. end of Mallicollo.
It is of an egg-like figure, very high, and
eighteen or twenty leagues in circuit. Its limits
were determined by several bearings; but the lines
of the shore were traced out by guess, except the
N.&nbsp;E. part, where is anchorage half a mile from the
land.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aurora, Whitsuntide, Ambrym, Paoom, and its
neighbour Apee, Threehills, and Sandwich Islands,
lie all nearly under the meridian of 167° 29ʹ or 30ʹ
East, extending from the latitude of 14° 51ʹ 30ʺ,
to 17° 53ʹ 30ʺ.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The island of Aurora lies N. by W. and S. by E.,
and is eleven leagues long in that direction; but I
believe it hardly any where exceeds two or two and
a half in breadth. It hath a good <a id='height'></a>height, its surface
hilly, and every where covered with wood,
except where the natives have their dwellings and
plantations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whitsuntide Isle, which is one league and a half
to the south of Aurora, is of the same length, and lies
in the direction of north and south, but is something
broader than Aurora Island. It is considerably high,
and clothed with wood, except such parts as seemed
to be cultivated, which were pretty numerous.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the south end of Whitsuntide Island to the
north side of Ambrym is two leagues and an half.
This is about seventeen leagues in circuit; its shores
are rather low, but the land rises with an unequal
ascent to a tolerably high mountain in the middle of
the island, from which ascended great columns of
smoke; but we were not able to determine whether
this was occasioned by a volcano or not. That it is
fertile and well inhabited seems probable from the
quantities of smoke which we saw rise out of the
woods, in such parts of the island as came within the
compass of our sight; for it must be observed, that
we did not see the whole of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>We saw still much less of Paoom, and its neighbourhood.
I can say no more of this island than
that it towers up to a great height, in the form of a
round hay-stack; and the extent of it, and of the adjoining
isle (if there are two) cannot exceed three
or four leagues in any direction; for the distance
between Ambrym and Apee is hardly five; and they
lie in this space, and east from Port Sandwich,
distant about seven or eight leagues.</p>

<p class='c000'>The island of Apee is not less than twenty leagues
in circuit; its longest direction is about eight leagues
N.&nbsp;W. and S.&nbsp;E.; it is of considerable height, and
hath a hilly surface, diversified with woods and lawns,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the west and south parts especially; for the others
we did not see.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shepherd’s Isles are a group of small ones of unequal
size, extending off from the S.&nbsp;E. point of
Apee about five leagues, in the direction of S.&nbsp;E.</p>

<p class='c000'>The island Threehills lies south four leagues from
the coast of Apee, and S.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
S., distant seventeen
leagues, from Port Sandwich: to this, and what has
been already said of it, I shall only add, that W. by
N., five miles from the west point, is a reef of rocks
on which the sea continually breaks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nine leagues, in the direction of south, from
Threehills, lies Sandwich Island. Twohills, the
Monument, and Montagu Islands, lie to the east of
this line, and Hinchinbrook to the west, as also two
or three small isles which lie between it and Sandwich
Island, to which they are connected by breakers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sandwich Island is twenty-five leagues in circuit;
its greatest extent is ten leagues; and it lies in the
direction of N.&nbsp;W. by W. and S.&nbsp;E. by E. The
N.&nbsp;W. coast of this island we only viewed at a distance;
therefore the chart in this part may be faulty,
so far as it regards the line of the coast, but no farther.
The distance from the south end of Mallicollo to the
N.&nbsp;W. end of Sandwich Island is twenty-two leagues
in the direction of S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the same direction lie Erromango, Tanna, and
Annattom. The first is 18 leagues from Sandwich
Island, and is twenty-four or twenty-five leagues in
circuit. The middle of it lies in the latitude of
18° 54ʹ, longitude 169° 19ʹ E., and it is of a good
height, as may be gathered from the distance we
were off when we first saw it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tanna lies six leagues from the south side of Erromango,
extending S.&nbsp;E. by S. and N.&nbsp;W. by N.
about eight leagues long in that direction, and every
where about three or four leagues broad.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Isle of Immer lies in the direction of N. by E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E., four leagues from Port Resolution in Tanna;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and the island of Erronan or Footoona east, in the
same direction, distant eleven leagues. This, which
is the most eastern island of all the Hebrides, did
not appear to be above five leagues in circuit, but of a
considerable height, and flat at top. On the N.&nbsp;E.
side is a little peak, seemingly disjoined from the isle,
but we thought it was connected by low land.</p>

<p class='c000'>Annattom, which is the southernmost island, is
situated in the latitude of 20° 3ʹ, longitude 170° 4ʹ,
and S. 30° East, eleven or twelve leagues from Port
Resolution. It is of a good height, with an hilly
surface; and more I must not say of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here follows the lunar observations by Mr. Wales,
for ascertaining the longitude of these islands, reduced
by the watch to Port Sandwich in Mallicollo, and
Port Resolution in Tanna.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is necessary to observe, that each set of observations,
consisting of between six and ten observed
distances of the sun and moon, or moon and stars,
the whole number amounts to several hundreds;
and these have been reduced, by means of the watch,
to all the islands; so that the longitude of each is
as well ascertained as that of the two ports above-mentioned.
As a proof of this I shall only observe,
that the longitude of the two ports, as pointed out
by the watch and by the observations, did not differ
two miles. This also shows what degree of accuracy
these observations are capable of, when multiplied to
a considerable number, made with different instruments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and with the sun and stars, or both sides of
the moon. By this last method, the errors which
may be either in the instruments or lunar tables,
destroy one another, and likewise those which may
arise from the observer himself; for some men may
observe closer than others. If we consider the
number of observations that may be obtained in the
course of a month (if the weather is favourable) we
shall perhaps find this method of finding the longitude
of places as accurate as most others; at least
it is the most easy, and attended with the least expense
to the observer. Every ship that goes to
foreign parts is, or may be, supplied with a sufficient
number of quadrants at a small expense; I mean
good ones, proper for making these observations.
For the difference of the price between a good and
bad one, I apprehend, can never be an object with
an officer. The most expensive article, and what is
in some measure necessary in order to arrive at the
utmost accuracy, is a good watch; but for common
use, and where that strict accuracy is not required,
this may be dispensed with. I have observed before,
in this journal, that this method of finding the longitude
is not so difficult but that any man, with
proper application, and a little practice, may soon
learn to make these observations as well as the
astronomers themselves. I have seldom known any
material difference between the observations made
by Mr. Wales, and those made by the officers at the
same time.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c009'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In observing the variation of the magnetic needle,
we found, as usual, our compasses differ among themselves,
sometimes near 2°; the same compass, too,
would sometimes make nearly this difference in the
variation on different days, and even between the
morning and evening of the same day, when our
change of situation has been but very little. By
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the mean of the observations which I made about
Erromango, and the S.&nbsp;E. part of these islands, the
variation of the compass was 10° 5ʹ 48ʺ East; and the
mean of those made about Tierra del Espiritu Santo,
gave 10° 5ʹ 30ʺ East. This is considerably more
than Mr. Wales found it to be at Tanna. I cannot
say what might occasion this difference in the variation
observed at sea and on shore, unless it be influenced
by the land; for I must give the preference
to that found at sea, as it is agreeable to what we
observed before we made the islands, and after we
left them.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>At sun-rise on the 1st of September, after having
stood to S.&nbsp;W. all night, no more land was to be
seen. The wind remaining in the S.&nbsp;E. quarter, we
continued to stand to S.&nbsp;W. On the 2d, at five
o’clock P.&nbsp;M., being in the latitude 18° 22ʹ, longitude
165° 26ʹ, the variation was 10° 50ʹ East; and at the
same hour on the 3d, it was 10° 51ʹ, latitude at that
time 19° 14ʹ, longitude 165° East. The next
morning, in the latitude of 19° 49ʹ, longitude 164° 53ʹ,
the amplitude gave 10° 21ʹ, and the azimuths 10° 7ʹ
East. At eight o’clock, as we were steering to the
south, land was discovered bearing S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W., and at
noon it extended from S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. to W. by S., distant
about six leagues. We continued to steer for it with
a light breeze at east, till five in the evening, when
we were stopped by a calm. At this time we were
three leagues from the land, which extended from
S.&nbsp;E. by S. to W. by N. round by the S.&nbsp;W. Some
openings appeared in the west, so that we could not
tell whether it was one connected land or a group of
islands. To the S.&nbsp;E. the coast seemed to terminate
in a high promontory, which I named Cape Colnett,
after one of my midshipmen, who first discovered this
land. Breakers were seen about half-way between
us and the shore; and, behind them, two or three
canoes under sail, standing out to sea, as if their
design had been to come off to us; but a little before
sun-set they struck their sails, and we saw them
no more. After a few hours’ calm, we got a breeze
at S.&nbsp;E., and spent the night standing off and on.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 5th, at sun-rise, the horizon being clear, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>could see the coast extend to the S.&nbsp;E. of Cape
Colnett, and round by the S.&nbsp;W. to N.&nbsp;W. by W.
Some gaps or openings were yet to be seen to the
west; and a reef, or breakers, seemed to lie all along
the coast, connected with those we discovered the
preceding night. It was a matter of indifference to
me whether we plied up the coast to the S.&nbsp;E. or
bore down to N.&nbsp;W. I chose the latter; and after
running two leagues down the outside of the reef
(for such it proved), we came before an opening
that had the appearance of a good channel, through
which we might go in for the land. I wanted to get
at it, not only to visit it, but also to have an opportunity
to observe an eclipse of the sun which was
soon to happen. With this view we brought to,
hoisted out two armed boats, and sent them to sound
the channel, ten or twelve large sailing canoes being
then near us. We had observed them coming off
from the shore, all the morning, from different parts;
and some were lying on the reef, fishing as we supposed.
As soon as they all got together, they came
down to us in a body, and were pretty near when we
were hoisting out our boats, which probably gave
them some alarm; for, without stopping, they hauled
in for the reef, and our boats followed them. We
now saw that what we had taken for openings in the
coast was low land, and that it was all connected,
except the western extremity, which was an island,
known by the name of Balabea, as we afterwards
learnt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boats having made a signal for a channel, and
one of them being placed on the point of the reef, on
the weather side of it, we stood in with the ship, and
took up the other boat in our way, when the officer
informed me, that where we were to pass, was sixteen
and fourteen fathoms water, a fine sandy bottom, and
that, having put along-side two canoes, he found the
people very obliging and civil. They gave him some
fish; and, in return, he presented them with medals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>&amp;c. In one was a stout robust young man, whom
they understood to be a chief. After getting within
the reef, we hauled up S.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E. for a small low sandy
isle that we observed lying under the shore, being
followed by all the canoes. Our sounding, in
standing in, was from fifteen to twelve fathoms, (a
pretty even fine sandy bottom,) for about two miles;
then we had six, five, and four fathoms. This was
on the tail of a shoal which lies a little without the
small isle to the N.&nbsp;E. Being over it, we found
seven and eight fathoms water, which shallowed
gradually, as we approached the shore, to three
fathoms, when we tacked, stood off a little, and then
anchored in five fathoms, the bottom a fine sand
mixed with mud. The little sandy isle bore E. by S.
three quarters of a mile distant; and we were one
mile from the shore of the main, which extended
from S.&nbsp;E. by E. round by the south to W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W.
The island of Balabea bore N.&nbsp;W. by N., and the
channel, through which we came, north, four miles
distant. In this situation we were extremely well
sheltered from the reigning winds, by the sandy isle
and its shoals, and by the shoal without them.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had hardly got to an anchor before we were
surrounded by a great number of the natives, in
sixteen or eighteen canoes, the most of whom were
without any sort of weapons. At first they were
shy of coming near the ship; but in a short time
we prevailed on the people in one boat to get close
enough to receive some presents. These we lowered
down to them by a rope; to which, in return, they
tied two fish that stunk intolerably, as did those they
gave us in the morning. These mutual exchanges
bringing on a kind of confidence, two ventured on
board the ship; and presently after she was filled
with them, and we had the company of several at
dinner in the cabin. Our pea-soup, salt-beef, and
pork, they had no curiosity to taste; but they eat of
some yams, which we happened to have yet left, calling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>them <i>Oobee</i>. This name is not unlike <i>Oofee</i>, as they
are called at most of the islands, except Mallicollo;
nevertheless, we found these people spoke a language
new to us. Like all the nations we had lately seen,
the men were almost naked, having hardly any other
covering but such a wrapper as is used at Mallicollo.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c009'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
They were curious in examining every part of the
ship, which they viewed with uncommon attention.
They had not the least knowledge of goats, hogs, dogs,
or cats, and had not even a name for one of them.
They seemed fond of large spike-nails, and pieces of
red cloth, or indeed of any other colour; but red
was their favourite.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>After dinner I went on shore with two armed
boats, having with us one of the natives who had
attached himself to me. We landed on a sandy
beach before a vast number of people, who had got
together with no other intent than to see us; for
many of them had not a stick in their hands; consequently
we were received with great courtesy, and
with the surprise natural for people to express at
seeing men and things so new to them as we must be.
I made presents to all those my friend pointed out, who
were either old men, or such as seemed to be of some
note; but he took not the least notice of some women
who stood behind the crowd, holding my hand when
I was going to give them some beads and medals.
Here we found the same chief who had been seen in
one of the canoes in the morning. His name, we
now learnt, was Teabooma; and we had not been on
shore above ten minutes, before he called for silence.
Being instantly obeyed by every individual present,
he made a short speech; and soon after another chief
having called for silence, made a speech also. It
was pleasing to see with what attention they were
heard. Their speeches were composed of short
sentences; to each of which two or three old men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>answered, by nodding their heads, and giving a kind
of grunt, significant, as I thought, of approbation.
It was impossible for us to know the purport of these
speeches; but we had reason to think they were
favourable to us, on whose account they doubtless
were made. I kept my eyes fixed on the people all
the time, and saw nothing to induce me to think
otherwise. While we were with them, having inquired,
by signs, for fresh water, some pointed to the
east, and others to the west. My friend undertook
to conduct us to it, and embarked with us for that
purpose. We rowed about two miles up the coast
to the east, where the shore was mostly covered with
mangrove trees; and entering amongst them, by a
narrow creek or river, which brought us to a little
straggling village above all the mangroves, there we
landed, and were shown fresh water. The ground
near this village was finely cultivated, being laid out
in plantations of sugar-canes, plantains, yams, and
other roots; and watered by little rills, conducted by
art from the main stream, whose source was in the
hills. Here were some cocoa-nut trees, which did
not seem burdened with fruit. We heard the crowing
of cocks, but saw none. Some roots were baking
on a fire, in an earthen jar, which would have held
six or eight gallons; nor did we doubt its being their
own manufacture. As we proceeded up the creek,
Mr. Forster having shot a duck flying over our heads,
which was the first use these people saw made of our
fire-arms, my friend begged to have it; and when he
landed, told his countrymen in what manner it was
killed. The day being far spent, and the tide not
permitting us to stay longer in the creek, we took
leave of the people, and got on board a little after
sunset. From this little excursion, I found that we
were to expect nothing from these people but the
privilege of visiting their country undisturbed. For
it was easy to see they had little else than good-nature
to bestow. In this they exceeded all the nations we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>had yet met with; and, although it did not satisfy
the demands of nature, it at once pleased and left
our minds at ease.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning we were visited by some hundreds
of the natives; some coming in canoes, and others
swimming off; so that before ten o’clock, our decks,
and all other parts of the ship, were quite full with
them. My friend, who was of the number, brought
me a few roots, but all the others came empty in respect
to eatables. Some few had with them their
arms, such as clubs and darts, which they exchanged
for nails, pieces of cloth, &amp;c. After breakfast, I sent
Lieutenant Pickersgill with two armed boats to look
for fresh water; for what we found the day before
was by no means convenient for us to get on board.
At the same time, Mr. Wales, accompanied by Lieutenant
Clerke, went to the little isle to make preparations
for observing the eclipse of the sun, which
was to be in the afternoon. Mr. Pickersgill soon
returning, informed me that he had found a stream
of fresh water, pretty convenient to come at. I
therefore ordered the launch to be hoisted out to
complete our water, and then went to the isle to
assist in the observation.</p>

<p class='c000'>About one P.&nbsp;M. the eclipse came on. Clouds
interposed, and we lost the first contact, but were
more fortunate in the end, which was observed as
follows:</p>

great addition to the use of this most valuable instrument.
After all was over, we returned on board,
where I found Teabooma the chief, who soon after
slipped out of the ship without my knowledge, and
by that means lost the present I had made up for
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the evening I went ashore to the watering-place,
which was at the head of a little creek, at a
fine stream that came from the hills. It was necessary
to have a small boat in the creek to convey the
casks from and to the beach over which they were
rolled, and then put into the launch; as only a small
boat could enter the creek, and that only at high
water. Excellent wood for fuel was here far more
convenient than water, but this was an article we
did not want. About seven o’clock this evening, died
Simon Monk, our butcher, a man much esteemed in
the ship; his death being occasioned by a fall down
the fore-hatchway the preceding night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the morning of the 7th, the watering-party,
and a guard, under the command of an officer,
were sent ashore; and soon after, a party of us went
to take a view of the country. As soon as we landed,
we made known our design to the natives, and two
of them undertaking to be our guides, conducted us
up the hills by a tolerably good path. In our route
we met several people, most of whom turned back
with us; so that at last our train was numerous.
Some we met who wanted us to return; but we paid
no regard to their signs, nor did they seem uneasy
when we proceeded. At length we reached the summit
of one of the hills, from which we saw the sea in
two places, between some advanced hills on the opposite
or S.&nbsp;W. side of the land. This was an useful
discovery, as it enabled us to judge of the breadth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>the land, which, in this part, did not exceed ten
leagues.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between those advanced hills and the ridge we
were upon, was a large valley, through which ran a
serpentine river. On the banks of this were several
plantations, and some villages, whose inhabitants we
had met on the road, and found more on the top of
the hill gazing at the ship, as might be supposed.
The plain or flat land, which lies along the
shore we were upon, appeared from the hills to a
great advantage; the winding streams which ran
through it, the plantations, the little straggling villages,
the variety in the woods, and the shoals on the
coast, so variegating the scene, that the whole might
afford a picture for romance. Indeed, if it were not
for those fertile spots on the plains, and some few on
the sides of the mountains, the whole country might
be called a dreary waste. The mountains and other
high places are, for the most part, incapable of cultivation,
consisting chiefly of rocks, many of which
are full of mundicks. The little soil that is upon
them is scorched and burnt up with the sun; it is,
nevertheless, coated with coarse grass and other
plants, and here and there trees and shrubs. The
country in general bore great resemblance to some
parts of New Holland under the same parallel of
latitude, several of its natural productions seeming
to be the same, and the woods being without underwood,
as in that country. The reefs on the coast,
and several other similarities, were obvious to every
one who had seen both countries. We observed all
the N.&nbsp;E. coast to be covered with shoals and breakers,
extending to the northward, beyond the isle of
Balabea, till they were lost in the horizon.—Having
made these observations, and our guides not choosing
to go farther, we descended the mountains by a road
different from that by which we ascended. This
brought us down through some of their plantations
in the plains, which, I observed, were laid out with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>great judgment, and cultivated with much labour.
Some of them were lying in fallow; some seemingly
lately laid down, and others of longer date, pieces of
which they were again beginning to dig up. The
first thing I observed they did, was to set fire to the
grass, &amp;c. which had over-run the surface. Recruiting
the land by letting it lie some years untouched,
is observed by all the nations in the sea; but they
seem to have no notion of manuring it, at least I
have no where seen it done. Our excursion was
finished by noon, when we returned on board to dinner;
and one of our guides having left us, we brought
the other with us, whose fidelity was rewarded at a
small expence.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the afternoon I made a little excursion along
shore to the westward, in company with Mr. Wales.
Besides making observations on such things as we
met, we got the names of several places, which I
then thought were islands; but upon farther enquiry,
I found they were districts upon this same
land. This afternoon, a fish being struck by one of
the natives near the watering-place, my clerk purchased
it, and sent it to me after my return on board.
It was of a new species, something like a sun-fish, with
a large, long, ugly head. Having no suspicion of
its being of a poisonous nature, we ordered it to be
dressed for supper; but very luckily, the operation
of drawing and describing took up so much time,
that it was too late, so that only the liver and row
were dressed, of which the two Mr. Forsters and myself
did but taste. About three o’clock in the morning,
we found ourselves seized with an extraordinary
weakness and numbness all over our limbs. I had almost
lost the sense of feeling, nor could I distinguish between
light and heavy bodies, of such as I had strength
to move; a quart pot full of water and a feather being
the same in my hand. We each of us took an emetic,
and after that a sweat, which gave us much relief.
In the morning, one of the pigs which had eaten the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>entrails was found dead. When the natives came on
board and saw the fish hang up, they immediately
gave us to understand it was not wholesome food, and
expressed the utmost abhorrence of it; though no
one was observed to do this when the fish was to be
sold, or even after it was purchased.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 8th, the guard and a party of men were
on shore as usual. In the afternoon I received a
message from the officer, acquainting me that
Teabooma, the chief, was come with a present,
consisting of a few yams and sugar-canes. In return
I sent him, amongst other articles, a dog and a
bitch, both young, but nearly full grown. The dog
was red and white, but the bitch was all red, or the
colour of an English fox. I mention this, because
they may prove the Adam and Eve of their species
in that country. When the officer returned on board
in the evening, he informed me that the chief came
attended by about twenty men, so that it looked like
a visit of ceremony. It was some time before he
would believe the dog and bitch were intended for
him; but as soon as he was convinced, he seemed
lost in an excess of joy, and sent them away immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning early I dispatched Lieutenant Pickersgill
and Mr. Gilbert, with the launch and cutter,
to explore the coast to the west; judging this would
be better effected in the boats than in the ship, as
the reefs would force the latter several leagues from
land. After breakfast, a party of men was sent ashore
to make brooms; but myself and the two Mr. Forsters
were confined on board, though much better, a
good sweat having had a happy effect. In the afternoon,
a man was seen, both ashore and alongside the
ship, said to be as white as any European. From the
account I had of him (for I did not see him) his
whiteness did not proceed from hereditary descent,
but from chance or some disease; and such have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>seen at Otaheite, and the Society Isles.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c009'><sup>[11]</sup></a> A fresh
easterly wind, and the ship lying a mile from the
shore, did not hinder these good-natured people from
swimming off to us in shoals of twenty or thirty, and
returning the same way.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 10th, a party was on shore as usual; and
Mr. Forster so well recovered as to go out botanizing.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the evening of the 11th the boats returned,
when I was informed of the following circumstances.
From an elevation, which they reached the morning
they set out, they had a view of the coast. Mr.
Gilbert was of opinion, that they saw the termination
of it to the west, but Mr. Pickersgill thought not;
though both agreed that there was no passage for the
ship that way. From this place, accompanied by
two of the natives, they went to Balabea, which they
did not reach till after sun-set, and left again next
morning before sun-rise; consequently this was a
fruitless expedition, and the two following days were
spent in getting up to the ship. As they went down
to the isle, they saw abundance of turtle but the
violence of the wind and sea made it impossible to
strike any. The cutter was near being lost, by suddenly
filling with water, which obliged them to throw
several things overboard, before they could free her
and stop the leak she had sprung. From a fishing
canoe, which they met coming in from the reefs, they
got as much fish as they could eat; and they were
received by Teabi, the chief of the isle of Balabea,
and the people, who came in numbers to see them,
with great courtesy. In order not to be too much
crowded, our people drew a line on the ground, and
gave the others to understand they were not to come
within it. This restriction they observed, and one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>of them, soon after, turned it to his own advantage.
For happening to have a few cocoa-nuts, which one
of our people wanted to buy, and he was unwilling
to part with, he walked off, and was followed by the
man who wanted them. On seeing this he sat down
on the sand, made a circle round him, as he had seen
our people do, and signified that the other was not to
come within it; which was accordingly observed. As
this story was well attested, I thought it not unworthy
of a place in this journal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the morning of the 12th, I ordered the
carpenter to work, to repair the cutter, and the water
to be replaced which we had expended the three
preceding days. As Teabooma, the chief, had not
been seen since he got the dogs, and I wanted to lay
a foundation for stocking the country with hogs also,
I took a young boar and sow with me in the boat, and
went up the mangrove creek to look for my friend,
in order to give them to him. But when we arrived
there, we were told that he lived at some distance,
and that they would send for him. Whether they
did or no, I cannot say; but he not coming, I resolved
to give them to the first man of note I met
with. The guide we had to the hills happening to
be there, I made him understand, that I intended to
leave the two pigs on shore, and ordered them out of
the boat for that purpose. I offered them to a grave
old man, thinking he was a proper person to intrust
them with; but he shook his head, and he, and all
present, made signs to take them into the boat again.
When they saw I did not comply, they seemed to
consult with one another what was to be done; and
then our guide told me to carry them to the <i>Alekee</i>
(chief). Accordingly I ordered them to be taken up,
and we were conducted by him to a house wherein
were seated, in a circle, eight or ten middle-aged
persons. To them I and my pigs being introduced,
with great courtesy they desired me to sit down;
and then I began to expatiate on the merits of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>two pigs, explaining to them how many young ones
the female would have at one time, and how soon
these would multiply to some hundreds. My only
motive was to enhance their value, that they might
take the more care of them; and I had reason to
think I, in some measure, succeeded. In the mean
time, two men having left the company, soon returned
with six yams, which were presented to me;
and then I took leave and went on board.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have already observed, that here was a little village;
I now found it much larger than I expected;
and, about it, a good deal of cultivated land, regularly
laid out, planted and planting with taro or eddy
root, yams, sugar-canes, and plantains. The taro
plantations were prettily watered by little rills, continually
supplied from the main channel at the foot
of the mountains, from whence these streams were
conducted in artful meanders. They have two methods
of planting these roots, some are in square or
oblong patches, which lie perfectly horizontal, and
sink below the common level of the adjacent land;
so that they can let in on them as much water as they
think necessary. I have generally seen them covered
two or three inches deep; but I do not know that
this is always necessary. Others are planted in ridges
about three or four feet broad, and two, or two and
a half high. On the middle or top of the ridge is
a narrow gutter, in and along which is conveyed, as
above described, a little rill that waters the roots
planted in the ridge, on each side of it; and these
plantations are so judiciously laid out, that the same
stream waters several ridges. These ridges are sometimes
the divisions to the horizontal plantations; and
when this method is used, which is for the most part
observed where a pathway or something of that sort is
requisite, not an inch of ground is lost. Perhaps
there may be some difference in the roots, which may
make these two methods of raising them necessary.
Some are better tasted than others, and they are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>all of a colour. But be this as it may, they are a
very wholesome food, and the tops make good greens,
and are eaten as such by the natives. On these
plantations, men, women, and children were employed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the afternoon I went on shore, and, on a large
tree, which stood close to the shore, near the watering
place, had an inscription cut, setting forth the
ship’s name, date, &amp;c. as a testimony of our being
the first discoverers of this country, as I had done at
all others at which we had touched, where this
ceremony was necessary. This being done, we took
leave of our friends, and returned on board; when
I ordered all the boats to be hoisted in, in order to
be ready to put to sea in the morning.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='b3c9' class='c004'>CHAP. IX.<br /> <br />A DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY AND ITS INHABITANTS; THEIR MANNERS, CUSTOMS, AND ARTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>I shall conclude our transactions at this place
with some account of the country and its inhabitants.
They are strong, robust, active, well-made people,
courteous and friendly, and not in the least addicted
to pilfering, which is more than can be said of any
other nation in this sea. They are nearly of the
same colour as the natives of Tanna, but have better
features, more agreeable countenances, and are a
much stouter race; a few being seen who measured
six feet four inches. I observed some who had thick
lips, flat noses, and full cheeks, and, in some degree,
the features and look of a negro. Two things contributed
to the forming of such an idea; first, their
ruff mop heads; and secondly, their besmearing their
faces with black pigment. Their hair and beards
are, in general, black. The former is very much
frizzled; so that, at first sight, it appears like that of
a negro. It is, nevertheless, very different; though
both coarser and stronger than ours. Some, who
wear it long, tie it up on the crown of the head;
others suffer only a large lock to grow on each side,
which they tie up in clubs; many others, as well as
all the women, wear it cropped short. These rough
heads, most probably, want frequent scratching, for
which purpose they have a most excellent instrument.
This is a kind of comb made of sticks of hard wood,
from seven to nine inches long, and about the thickness
of knitting needles. A number of these, seldom
exceeding twenty, but generally fewer, are
fastened together at one end, parallel to, and near
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>th</span>
of an inch from each other. The other ends,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>which are a little pointed, will spread out or open like
the sticks of a fan, by which means they can beat up
the quarters of an hundred lice at a time. These
combs or scratchers, for I believe they serve both
purposes, they always wear in their hair, on one side
their head. The people of Tanna have an instrument
of this kind, for the same use; but theirs is
forked, I think never exceeding three or four prongs;
and sometimes only a small pointed stick. Their
beards, which are of the same crisp nature as their
hair, are, for the most part, worn short. Swelled
and ulcerated legs and feet are common among the
men; as also a swelling of the scrotum. I know
not whether this is occasioned by disease, or by the
mode of applying the wrapper before mentioned,
and which they use as at Tanna and Mallicollo. This
is their only covering, and is made generally of the
bark of a tree, but sometimes of leaves. The small
pieces of cloth, paper, &amp;c. which they got from us,
were commonly applied to this use. We saw coarse
garments amongst them, made of a sort of matting,
but they seemed never to wear them, except when
out in their canoes and unemployed. Some had a
kind of concave, cylindrical, stiff black cap, which
appeared to be a great ornament among them, and,
we thought, was only worn by men of note, or warriors.
A large sheet of strong paper, when they got
one from us, was generally applied to this use.</p>

<p class='c000'>The women’s dress is a short petticoat, made of
the filaments of the plantain tree, laid over a cord,
to which they are fastened, and tied round the
waist. The petticoat is made at least six or eight
inches thick, but not one inch longer than necessary
for the use designed. The outer filaments are dyed
black; and, as an additional ornament, the most of
them have a few pearl oyster-shells fixed on the right
side. The general ornaments of both sexes, are ear-rings
of tortoise-shell, necklaces or amulets, made
both of shells and stones, and bracelets, made of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>large shells, which they wear above the elbow. They
have punctures, or marks on the skin, on several
parts of the body; but none, I think, are black, as
at the eastern islands. I know not if they have any
other design than ornament; and the people of Tanna
are marked much in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Were I to judge of the origin of this nation, I
should take them to be a race between the people of
Tanna and of the Friendly Isles; or between those
of Tanna and the New Zealanders, or all three; their
language, in some respects, being a mixture of them
all. In their disposition they are like the natives of
the Friendly Isles, but in affability and honesty they
excel them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding their pacific inclination, they must
sometimes have wars, as they are well provided with
offensive weapons; such as clubs, spears, darts, and
slings for throwing stones. The clubs are about two
feet and a half long, and variously formed; some like a
scythe, others like a pick-axe; some have a head like
an hawk, and others have round heads; but all are
neatly made. Many of their darts and spears are
no less neat, and ornamented with carvings. The
slings are as simple as possible; but they take some
pains to form the stones that they use into a proper
shape; which is something like an egg, supposing
both ends to be like the small one. They use a
becket, in the same manner as at Tanna, in throwing
the dart, which, I believe, is much used in striking
fish, &amp;c. In this they seem very dexterous; nor,
indeed, do I know that they have any other method
of catching large fish; for I neither saw hooks nor
lines among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is needless to mention their working tools, as
they are made of the same materials, and nearly in
the same manner, as at the other islands. Their axes,
indeed, are a little different; some, at least; which
may be owing to fancy as much as custom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their houses, or at least most of them, are circular;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>something like a bee-hive, and full as close
and warm. The entrance is by a small door, or
long square hole, just big enough to admit a man
bent double. The side walls are about four feet and
a half high; but the roof is lofty, and peaked to a
point at the top, above which is a post or stick of
wood, which is generally ornamented either with
carving or shells, or both. The framing is of small
spars, reeds, &amp;c. and both sides and roof are thick
and close covered with thatch, made of coarse long
grass. In the inside of the house are set up posts,
to which cross spars are fastened and platforms made
for the conveniency of laying any thing on. Some
houses have two floors, one above the other. The
floor is laid with dry grass, and here and there mats
are spread for the principal people to sleep or sit on.
In most of them we found two fire-places, and commonly
a fire burning, and, as there was no vent for
the smoke but by the door, the whole house was both
smoky and hot, insomuch that we, who are not
used to such an atmosphere, could hardly endure it a
moment. This may be the reason why we found
these people so chilly when in the open air and without
exercise. We frequently saw them make little
fires any where, and hustle round them, with no other
view than to warm themselves. Smoke within doors
may be a necessary evil, as it prevents the musquitoes
from coming in, which are pretty numerous here.
In some respects their habitations are neat; for,
besides the ornaments at top, I saw some with carved
door-posts. Upon the whole, their houses are better
calculated for a cold than a hot climate; and as
there are no partitions in them, they can have little
privacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>They have no great variety of household utensils;
the earthen jars before mentioned being the only
article worth notice. Each family has, at least, one
of them, in which they bake their roots, and perhaps
their fish, &amp;c. The fire by which they cook their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>victuals, is on the outside of each house, in the open
air. There are three or five pointed stones fixed in
the ground, their pointed ends being about six inches
above the surface, in this form:
<a href="images/i_122.jpg"><img src="images/i_122.jpg"
style="width:300px;" alt="Illustration of pointed stones" /></a>
Those of three stones, are only
for one jar, those of five stones,
for two. The jars do not stand
on their bottoms, but lie inclined
on their sides. The use of these stones is, obviously,
to keep the jars from resting on the fire, in order that
it may burn the better.</p>

<p class='c000'>They subsist chiefly on roots and fish, and the bark
of a tree, which I am told grows also in the West
Indies. This they roast, and are almost continually
chewing. It has a sweetish, insipid taste; and was
liked by some of our people. Water is their only
liquor; at least, I never saw any other made use of.</p>

<p class='c000'>Plantains and sugar-canes are by no means in
plenty. Bread-fruit is very scarce, and the cocoa-nut
trees are small and but thinly planted; and neither
one nor the other seems to yield much fruit.</p>

<p class='c000'>To judge merely by the numbers of the natives
we saw every day, one might think the island very
populous; but, I believe, that at this time, the inhabitants
were collected from all parts on our account.
Mr. Pickersgill observed, that down the coast, to the
west, there were but few people; and we knew they came
daily from the other side of the land, over the mountains,
to visit us. But although the inhabitants, upon the
whole, may not be numerous, the island is not thinly
peopled on the sea-coast, and in the plains and valleys
that are capable of cultivation. It seems to be
a country unable to support many inhabitants. Nature
has been less bountiful to it than to any other
tropical island we know in this sea. The greatest part
of its surface, or at least what we saw of it, consists
of barren, rocky mountains, and the grass, &amp;c.
growing on them, is useless to people who have no
cattle.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>The sterility of the country will apologize for
the natives not contributing to the wants of the navigator.
The sea may, perhaps, in some measure,
compensate for the deficiency of the land; for a coast
surrounded by reefs and shoals as this is, cannot fail
of being stored with fish.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have before observed, that the country bears
great resemblance to New South Wales, or New
Holland, and that some of its natural productions are
the same. In particular, we found here the tree
which is covered with a soft white ragged bark, easily
peeled off, and is, as I have been told, the same that
in the East Indies is used for caulking of ships. The
wood is very hard, the leaves are long and narrow,
of a pale dead green, and a fine aromatic; so that
it may properly be said to belong to that continent.
Nevertheless, here are several plants, &amp;c. common
to the eastern and northern islands, and even a species
of the passion-flower, which, I am told, has never
before been known to grow wild any where but in
America. Our botanists did not complain for want of
employment at this place; every day bringing something
new in botany or other branches of natural history.
Land-birds, indeed, are not numerous, but
several are new. One of these is a kind of crow, at
least so we called it, though it is not half so big,
and its feathers are tinged with blue. They also have
some very beautiful turtle-doves, and other small birds,
such as I never saw before.</p>

<p class='c000'>All our endeavours to get the name of the whole
island proved ineffectual. Probably, it is too large
for them to know by one name. Whenever we made
this enquiry, they always gave us the name of some
district or place, which we pointed to; and, as before
observed, I got the names of several, with the
name of the king or chief of each. Hence, I conclude,
that the country is divided into several districts,
each governed by a chief; but we know nothing of
the extent of his power. Balade was the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the district we were at, and Tea Booma the chief.
He lived on the other side of the ridge of hills, so
that we had but little of his company, and therefore
could not see much of his power. <i>Tea</i> seems a title
prefixed to the names of all or most of their chiefs or
great men. My friend honoured me by calling me
<i>Tea</i> Cook.</p>

<p class='c000'>They deposit their dead in the ground. I saw
none of their burying-places; but several of the
gentlemen did. In one, they were informed, lay the
remains of a chief, who was slain in battle; and his
grave, which bore some resemblance to a large molehill,
was decorated with spears, darts, paddles, &amp;c.
all stuck upright in the ground round about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The canoes which these people use, are somewhat
like those of the Friendly Isles: but the most heavy,
clumsy vessels I ever saw. They are what I call
double canoes, made out of two large trees hollowed
out, having a raised gunnel about two inches high,
and closed at each end with a kind of bulk head of the
same height; so that the whole is like a long square
trough, about three feet shorter than the body of the
canoe; that is, a foot and an half at each end. Two
canoes, thus fitted, are secured to each other, about
three feet asunder, by means of cross spars, which
project about a foot over each side. Over these
spars is laid a deck or very heavy platform, made of
plank and small round spars, on which they have a
fire hearth, and generally a fire burning; and they
carry a pot or jar to dress their victuals in. The space
between the two canoes is laid with plank, and the
rest with spars. On one side of the deck, and close
to the edge, is fixed a row of knees, pretty near to
each other, the use of which is to keep the mast,
yards, &amp;c. from rolling over-board. They are navigated
by one or two latteen sails, extended to a small
latteen yard, the end of which fixes in a notch or
hole in the deck. The foot of the sail is extended to a
small boom. The sail is composed of pieces of matting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the ropes are made of the coarse filaments of the
plantain tree, twisted into cords of the thickness of
a finger; and three or four more such cords, marled
together, serve them for shrouds, &amp;c. I thought
they sailed very well; but they are not at all calculated
for rowing or paddling. Their method of proceeding,
when they cannot sail, is by sculling; and
for this purpose there are holes in the boarded
deck or platform. Through these they put the
sculls, which are of such a length, that, when the
blade is in the water, the loom or handle is four
or five feet above the deck. The man who works
it stands behind, and with both his hands sculls
the vessel forward. This method of proceeding
is very slow, and for this reason, the canoes are
but ill calculated for fishing, especially for striking of
turtle, which, I think, can hardly ever be done in
them. Their fishing implements, such as I have
seen, are turtle nets, made, I believe, of the filaments
of the plantain tree, twisted; and small hand
nets, with very minute meshes made of fine twine
and fish gigs. Their general method of fishing, I
guess, is to lie on the reefs in shoal water, and to
strike the fish that may come in their way. They may,
however, have other methods, which we had no opportunity
to see, as no boat went out while we were
here, all their time and attention being taken up
with us. Their canoes are about thirty feet long, and
the deck or platform about twenty-four in length and
ten in breadth. We had not, at this time, seen any
timber in the country so large as that of which their
canoes were made. It was observed, that the holes
made in the several parts, in order to sew them together,
were burnt through, but with what instrument
we never learnt; most probably it was of stone;
which may be the reason why they were so fond of
large spikes, seeing at once they would answer this
purpose. I was convinced they were not wholly designed
for edge tools; because every one showed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>desire for the iron belaying pins which were fixed in
the quarter deck rail, and seemed to value them far
more than a spike-nail, although it might be twice
as big. These pins, which are round, perhaps have
the very shape of the tool they wanted to make of
the nails. I did not find that a hatchet was quite so
valuable as a large spike. Small nails were of little
or no value; and beads, looking-glasses, &amp;c. they
did not admire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The women of this country, and likewise those of
Tanna, are, so far as I could judge, far more chaste
than those of the more eastern islands. I never
heard that one of our people obtained the least favour
from any one of them. I have been told, that the
ladies here would frequently divert themselves, by
going a little aside with our gentlemen, as if they
meant to be kind to them, and then would run away
laughing at them. Whether this was chastity or
coquetry, I shall not pretend to determine; nor is it
material, since the consequences were the same.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>Every thing being in readiness to put to sea, at
sunrise, on the 13th of September, we weighed, and
with a fine gale at E. by S., stood out for the same
channel we came in by. At half past seven we were
in the middle of it. Observatory Isle bore S. 5° E., distant
four miles, and the Isle of Balabea W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. As
soon as we were clear of the reef, we hauled the wind
on the starboard tack, with a view of plying in to the
S.&nbsp;E.; but as Mr. Gilbert was of opinion that he had
seen the end or N.&nbsp;W. extremity of the land, and
that it would be easier to get round by the N.&nbsp;W., I
gave over plying, and bore up along the outside of
the reef, steering N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W., N.&nbsp;W., and N.&nbsp;W. by W.
as it trended. At noon the island of Balabea bore S.
by W., distant thirteen miles; and what we judged
to be the west end of the great land, bore S.&nbsp;W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
S.,
and the direction of the reef was N.&nbsp;W. by W., latitude
observed 19° 53ʹ 20ʺ. Longitude from Observatory
Isle 14ʹ W. We continued to steer N.&nbsp;W.
by W. along the outside of the reef till three o’clock,
at which time the Isle of Balabea bore S. by E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E.
In this direction we observed a partition in the reef,
which we judged to be a channel, by the strong tide
which set out of it. From this place the reef inclined
to the north, for three or four leagues, and then to
N.&nbsp;W. We followed its direction, and as we advanced
to N.&nbsp;W., raised more land, which seemed to be connected
with what we had seen before; so that Mr.
Gilbert was mistaken, and did not see the extremity
of the coast. At five o’clock this land bore
W. by N.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
N., distant twenty miles; but what we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>could see of the reef trended in the direction of
N.&nbsp;W. by N.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having hauled the wind on the starboard tack, and
spent the night plying, on the 14th, at sunrise, the
Island of Balabea bore S. 6° East, and the land seen
the preceding night west, but the reef still trended
N.&nbsp;W., along which we steered, with a light breeze at
E.&nbsp;S. E. At noon we observed in latitude 19° 28ʹ,
longitude from Observatory Isle 27ʹ West. We had
now no sight of Balabea; and the other land, that is,
the N.&nbsp;W. part of it, bore W. by S.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
S.; but we were
not sure if this was one continued coast, or separate
islands. For though some partitions were seen, from
space to space, which made it look like the latter, a
multitude of shoals rendered a nearer approach to it
exceedingly dangerous, if not impracticable. In the
afternoon, with a fine breeze at E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., we ranged the
outside of these shoals, which we found to trend in
the direction of N.&nbsp;W. by W., N.&nbsp;W. by N., and
N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. At three o’clock we passed a low sandy
isle, lying on the outer edge of the reef; in latitude
19° 25ʹ, and in the direction of N.&nbsp;E. from the north-westernmost
land, six or seven leagues distant. So
much as we could see of this space was strewed with
shoals, seemingly detached from each other; and the
channel leading in amongst them, appeared to be on
the S.&nbsp;E. side of the sandy isle; at least there was a
space where the sea did not break. At sunset,
we could but just see the land, which bore S.&nbsp;W.
by S., about ten leagues distant. A clear horizon
produced the discovery of no land to the westward
of this direction; the reef too, trended away W. by N.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
N., and seemed to terminate in a point which was
seen from the mast head. Thus every thing conspired
to make us believe that we should soon get
round these shoals; and with these flattering expectations
we hauled the wind, which was at E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E., and
spent the night making short boards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning, at sunrise, seeing neither land nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>breakers, we bore away N.&nbsp;W. by W., and two hours
after saw the reef extending N.&nbsp;W. farther than the
eye could reach; but no land was to be seen. It was
therefore probable, that we had passed its N.&nbsp;W. extremity;
and, as we had seen from the hills of Balade
its extent to the S.&nbsp;W., it was necessary to know how
far it extended to the E. or S.&nbsp;E. while it was in our
power to recover the coast. For, by following the
direction of the shoals, we might have been carried
so far to leeward as not to be able to beat back without
considerable loss of time. We were already far
out of sight of land; and there was no knowing how
much farther we might be carried, before we found
an end to them. These considerations, together with
the risk we must run in exploring a sea strewed
with shoals, and where no anchorage, without them,
is to be found, induced me to abandon the design
of proceeding round by the N.&nbsp;W., and to ply up to
the S.&nbsp;E., in which direction I knew there was a clear
sea. With this view, we tacked and stood to the
S.&nbsp;E., with the wind at N.&nbsp;E. by E., a gentle breeze.
At this time we were in the latitude of 19° 7ʹ S., longitude
165° 57ʹ East.</p>

<p class='c000'>In standing to S.&nbsp;E. we did but just weather the
point of the reef we had passed the preceding evening.
To make our situation the more dangerous, the
wind began to fail us; and at three in the afternoon
it fell calm, and left us to the mercy of a great
swell, setting directly on the reef, which was hardly
a league from us. We sounded, but found no bottom,
with a line of 200 fathoms. I ordered the pinnace
and cutter to be hoisted out to tow the ship;
but they were of little use against so great a swell.
We, however, found that the ship did not draw near
the reef so fast as might be expected; and at seven
o’clock, a light air at N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. kept her head to the
sea, but it lasted no longer than midnight, when it
was succeeded by a dead calm.</p>

<p class='c000'>At day-break, on the 16th, we had no sight of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>reef; and at eleven, a breeze springing up at S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W.
we hoisted in the boats, and made sail to S.&nbsp;E. At
noon we observed in 19° 35ʹ South, which was considerably
more to the south than we expected, and
showed that a current or tide had been in our favour
all night, and accounted for our getting so unexpectedly
clear of the shoals. At two o’clock P.&nbsp;M. we
had again a calm, which lasted till nine, when it was
succeeded by a light air from E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. and E., with
which we advanced but slowly.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 17th, at noon, we observed in latitude
19° 54ʹ, when the Isle of Balabea bore S. 60° West,
ten and a half leagues distant. We continued to ply,
with variable light winds, between N.&nbsp;E. and S.&nbsp;E.
without meeting with any thing remarkable till the
20th at noon, when Cape Colnet bore N. 78° West,
distant six leagues. From this cape the land extended
round by the south to E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. till it was lost
in the horizon; and the country appeared with many
hills and vallies. Latitude observed 20° 41ʹ, longitude
made from Observatory Isle 1° 8ʹ East. We
stood in shore with a light breeze at east till sunset,
when we were between two and three leagues off.
The coast extended from S. 42°
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
East to N. 59°
West. Two small islets lay without this last direction,
distant from us four or five miles; some others
lay between us and the shore, and to the east, where
they seemed to be connected by reefs, in which appeared
some openings from space to space. The
country was mountainous, and had much the same
aspect as about Balade. On one of the western small
isles was an elevation like a tower; and, over a low
neck of land within the isle, were seen many other
elevations resembling the masts of a fleet of ships.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next day, at sunrise, after having stood off all
night with a light breeze at S.&nbsp;E., we found ourselves
about six leagues from the coast; and in this situation
we were kept by a calm till ten in the evening,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>when we got a faint land breeze at S.&nbsp;W., with which
we steered S.&nbsp;E. all night.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 22d, at sunrise, the land was clouded, but
it was not long before the clouds went off, and we
found, by our land-marks, that we had made a good
advance. At ten o’clock, the land-breeze being succeeded
by a sea-breeze at E. by S., this enabled us to
stand in for the land, which at noon extended from
N. 78° West, to S.
<span class='nobreak'>31<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>°</span>
East, round by the south. In
this last direction the coast seemed to trend more to
the south in a lofty promontory, which, on account
of the day, received the name of Cape Coronation.
Latitude 22° 2ʹ, longitude 167°
<span class='nobreak'>7<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>ʹ</span>
East. Some breakers
lay between us and the shore, and probably they
were connected with those we had seen before.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the night we had advanced about two
leagues to S.&nbsp;E., and at day-break, on the 23d, an elevated
point appeared in sight beyond Cape Coronation,
bearing S. 23° East. It proved to be the S.&nbsp;E. extremity
of the coast, and obtained the name of Queen
Charlotte’s Foreland. Latitude 22° 16ʹ S., longitude
167° 14ʹ East. About noon, having got a breeze from
the N.&nbsp;E., we stood to S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., and, as we drew towards
Cape Coronation, saw in a valley to the south
of it, a vast number of those elevated objects before-mentioned;
and some low land under the Foreland
was wholly covered with them. We could not
agree in our opinions of what they were. I supposed
them to be a singular sort of trees, being too numerous
to resemble any thing else; and a great deal of
smoke kept rising all the day from amongst those
near the Cape. Our philosophers were of opinion
that this was the smoke of some internal and perpetual
fire. My representing to them that there was
no smoke here in the morning, would have been of
no avail, had not this eternal fire gone out before
night, and no more smoke been seen after. They
were still more positive, that the elevations were
pillars of basaltes, like those which compose the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Giant’s Causeway in Ireland. At sunset, the wind
veering round to the south, we tacked and stood
off, it not being safe to approach the shore in the
dark. At day-break we stood in again, with a faint
land-breeze between E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. and S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. At noon
observed in latitude 21° 59ʹ 30ʺ, Cape Coronation
bearing west southerly, distant seven leagues, and
the Foreland S. 38° West. As we advanced to S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W.
the coast beyond the Foreland began to appear in
sight; and, at sunset, we discovered a low island
lying S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., about seven miles from the Foreland.
It was one of those which are generally surrounded
with shoals and breakers. At the same time a round
hill was seen bearing S. 24° East, twelve leagues distant.
During night, having had variable light winds,
we advanced but little either way.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 25th, about ten o’clock A.&nbsp;M., having got a
fair breeze at E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., we stood to S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W., in hopes of
getting round the Foreland; but, as we drew near,
we perceived more low isles beyond the one already
mentioned, which at last appeared to be connected
by breakers, extending towards the Foreland, and
seeming to join the shore. We stood on till half-past
three o’clock, when we saw, from the deck, rocks
just peeping above the surface of the sea, on the shoal
above mentioned. It was now time to alter the
course, as the day was too far spent to look for
a passage near the shore, and we could find no bottom
to anchor in during the night. We therefore
stood to the south, to look for a passage without
the small isles. We had a fine breeze at E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., but
it lasted no longer than five o’clock, when it fell to
a dead calm. Having sounded, a line of 170 fathoms
did not reach the bottom, though we were but a little
way from the shoals, which, instead of following the
coast to S.&nbsp;W., took a S.&nbsp;E. direction towards the hill
we had seen the preceding evening, and seemed to
point out to us that it was necessary to go round that
land. At this time the most advanced point on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>main bore S. 68° West, distant nine or ten leagues.
About seven o’clock we got a light breeze at north,
which enabled us to steer out E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., and to spend
the night with less anxiety. On some of the low isles
were many of those elevations already mentioned.
Every one was now satisfied they were trees, except
our philosophers; who still maintained that they were
basaltes.</p>

<p class='c000'>About day break, on the 26th, the wind having
shifted to S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W., we stretched to S.&nbsp;E. for the hill before
mentioned. It belonged to an island, which at
noon extended from S. 16° E. to S. 7° West, distant
six leagues. Latitude observed 22° 16ʹ South. In
the P.&nbsp;M. the wind freshened, and, veering to
S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., we stretched to the east, till two A.&nbsp;M. on the
27th, when we tacked and stood to S.&nbsp;W. with hopes
of weathering the island; but we fell about two
miles short of our expectations, and had to tack about
a mile from the east side of the island, the
extremes bearing from N.&nbsp;W. by N. to S.&nbsp;W. the hill
west, and some low isles, lying off the S.&nbsp;E. point,
S. by W. These seemed to be connected with the
large island by breakers. We sounded when in stays,
but had no ground with a line of eighty fathoms.
The skirts of this island were covered with the elevations
more than once mentioned. They had much
the appearance of tall pines, which occasioned my
giving that name to the island. The round hill, which
is on the S.&nbsp;W. side, is of such a height as to be seen
fourteen or sixteen leagues. The island is about a
mile in circuit, and situated in latitude 22° 38ʹ S.,
longitude 167° 40ʹ East. Having made two attempts
to weather the Isle of Pines before sunset, with no
better success than before, this determined me to
stretch off till midnight. This day at noon the thermometer
was at 68°
<span class='nobreak'><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>,</span>
which is lower than it had
been since the 27th of February.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having tacked at midnight, assisted by the currents,
and a fresh gale at E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. and S.&nbsp;E., next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>morning, at daybreak, we found ourselves several
leagues to windward of the Isle of Pines, and bore
away large, round the S.&nbsp;E., and south sides. The
coast from the S.&nbsp;E., round by the south to the west,
was strewed with sand-banks, breakers, and small low
isles, most of which were covered with the same lofty
trees that ornamented the borders of the greater one.
We continued to range the outside of these small isles
and breakers, at three-fourths of a league distance,
and as we passed, one raised another; so that they
seemed to form a chain extending to the isles which
lie off the Foreland. At noon we observed, in
latitude 22° 44ʹ 36ʺ South, the Isle of Pines, extending
from N. by E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E. to E. by N., and Cape Coronation
N. 32° 30ʹ West, distant seventeen leagues. In the
afternoon, with a fine gale at E., we steered N.&nbsp;W.
by W. along the outside of the shoals, with a view of
falling in with the land a little to S.&nbsp;W. of the Foreland.
At two o’clock P.&nbsp;M. two low islets were seen
bearing W. by S., and as they were connected by
breakers, which seemed to join those on our starboard,
this discovery made it necessary to haul off S.&nbsp;W. in
order to get clear of them all. At three, more
breakers appeared, extending from the low isles towards
the S.&nbsp;E. We now hauled out close to the
wind; and, in an hour and an half, were almost on
board the breakers, and obliged to tack. From the
mast-head, they were seen to extend as far as E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.,
and the smoothness of the sea made it probable that
they extended to the north of east, and that we were
in a manner surrounded by them. At this time the
hill on the Isle of Pines bore N.
<span class='nobreak'>71<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>°</span>
East, the
Foreland N.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span>
W., and the most advanced point of
land on the S.&nbsp;W. coast bore N.&nbsp;W., distant fifteen or
sixteen leagues. This direction of the S.&nbsp;W. coast,
which was rather within the parallel of the N.&nbsp;E.,
assured us that this land extended no farther to the
S.&nbsp;W. After making a short trip to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E., we stood
again to the south, in expectation of having a better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>view of the shoals before sunset. We gained nothing
by this but the prospect of a sea strewed with shoals,
which we could not clear but by returning in the
track by which we came. We tacked nearly in
the same place where we had tacked before, and on
sounding found a bottom of fine sand. But anchoring
in a strong gale, with a chain of breakers to
leeward, being the last resource, I rather chose to
spend the night in making short boards over that
space we had, in some measure, made ourselves acquainted
with in the day. And thus it was spent;
but under the terrible apprehension, every moment,
of falling on some of the many dangers which surrounded
us.</p>

<p class='c000'>Daylight showed that our fears were not ill-founded,
and that we had been in the most imminent
danger; having had breakers continually under our
lee, and at a very little distance from us. We owed
our safety to the interposition of Providence, a good
look-out, and the very brisk manner in which the
ship was managed; for, as we were standing to the
north, the people on the lee gangway and forecastle
saw breakers under the lee-bow, which we escaped
by quickly tacking the ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was now almost tired of a coast which I could no
longer explore, but at the risk of losing the ship
and ruining the whole voyage. I was, however, determined
not to leave it, till I knew what trees those
were which had been the subject of our speculation;
especially as they appeared to be of a sort useful to
shipping, and had not been seen any where but in
the southern part of this land. With this view, after
making a trip to the south, to weather the shoals
under our lee, we stood to the north, in hopes of
finding anchorage under some of the islets on which
these trees grew. We were stopped by eight o’clock
by the shoals which lie extended between the Isle of
Pines and Queen Charlotte’s Foreland; and found
soundings off them in fifty-five, forty, and thirty-six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>fathoms, a fine sandy bottom. The nearer we came
to these shoals, the more we saw of them, and we
were not able to say if there was any passage between
the two lands.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being now but a few miles to windward of the low
isles lying off the Foreland, mentioned on the 25th
and 26th, I bore down to the one next to us. As
we drew near it I perceived that it was unconnected
with the neighbouring shoals, and that it is probable
we might get to an anchor under its lee or west side.
We therefore stood on, being conducted by an officer
at the mast-head; and after hauling round the point
of the reef which surrounds the isle, we attempted to
ply to windward, in order to get nearer the shore.
Another reef to the north confined us to a narrow
channel, through which ran a current against us, that
rendered this attempt fruitless; so that we were
obliged to anchor in thirty-nine fathoms’ water, the
bottom fine coral sand; the isle bearing W. by N., one
mile distant. As soon as this was done, we hoisted
out a boat, in which I went ashore, accompanied
by the botanists. We found the tall trees to be a
kind of spruce pine, very proper for spars, of which
we were in want. After making this discovery, I
hastened on board in order to have more time after
dinner, when I landed again with two boats, accompanied
by several of the officers and gentlemen,
having with us the carpenter and some of his crew,
to cut down such trees as were wanting. While this
was doing, I took the bearings of several lands round.
The hill on the Isle of Pines bore S. 59° 30ʹ E.; the
low point of Queen Charlotte’s Foreland N. 14° 30ʹ
West; the high land over it, seen over two low isles,
N. 20° West; and the most advanced point of land
to the west, bore west, half a point south, distant
six or seven leagues. We had, from several bearings,
ascertained the true direction of the coast from the
Foreland to this point, which I shall distinguish by
the name of Prince of Wales’s Foreland. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>situated in the latitude of 22° 29ʹ S., longitude 166°
57ʹ E., is of a considerable height, and, when it first
appears above the horizon, looks like an island. From
this cape the coast trended nearly N.&nbsp;W. This was
rather too northerly a direction to join that part
which we saw from the hills of Balade. But as it
was very high land which opened off the cape in that
direction, it is very probable that lower land, which
we could not see, opened sooner; or else the coast
more to the N.&nbsp;W. takes a more westerly direction,
in the same manner as the N.&nbsp;E. coast. Be this as it
may, we pretty well know the extent of the land, by
having it confined within certain limits. However,
I still entertained hopes of seeing more of it; but
was disappointed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The little isle upon which we landed, is a mere
sand bank, not exceeding three-fourths of a mile in
circuit, and on it, besides these pines, grew the <i>Etos</i>
tree of Otaheite, and a variety of other trees, shrubs,
and plants. These gave sufficient employment to
our botanists, all the time we <a id='staid'></a>staid upon it, and
occasioned my calling it Botany Isle. On it were
several water-snakes, some pigeons and doves, seemingly
different from any we had seen. One of the
officers shot a hawk, which proved to be of the very
same sort as our English fishing-hawks. Several
fire-places, branches, and leaves very little decayed,
remains of turtle, &amp;c. showed that people had lately
been on the isle. The hull of a canoe, precisely of
the same shape as those we had seen at Balade, lay
wrecked in the sand. We were now no longer at a
loss to know of what trees they make their canoes, as
they can be no other than these pines. On this
little isle were some which measured twenty inches
diameter, and between sixty and seventy feet in
length, and would have done very well for a fore-mast
to the Resolution, had one been wanting.
Since trees of this size are to be found on so small a
spot, it is reasonable to expect to find some much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>larger on the main, and larger isles, and, if appearances
did not deceive us, we can assert it.</p>

<p class='c000'>If I except New Zealand, I, at this time, knew of
no island in the South Pacific Ocean, where a ship
could supply herself with a mast or a yard, were she
ever so much distressed for want of one. Thus far
the discovery is or may be valuable. My carpenter,
who was a mast-maker as well as a ship-wright, two
trades he learnt in Deptford yard, was of opinion
that these trees would make exceedingly good masts.
The wood is white, close-grained, tough, and light.
Turpentine had exuded out of most of the trees, and
the sun had inspissated it into a rosin, which was
found sticking to the trunks, and lying about the
roots. These trees shoot out their branches like
all other pines; with this difference, that the branches
of these are much smaller and shorter; so that the
knots become nothing when the tree is wrought for
use. I took notice, that the largest of them had the
smallest and shortest branches, and were crowned, as
it were, at the top, by a spreading branch like a bush.
This was what led some on board into the extravagant
notion of their being basaltes: indeed, no one
could think of finding such trees here.—The seeds
are produced in cones; but we could find none that
had any in them, or that were in a proper state for
vegetable or botanical examination. Besides these,
there was another tree or shrub of the spruce fir kind;
but it was very small. We also found on the isle a
sort of scurvy-grass, and a plant, called by us Lamb’s
Quarters, which, when boiled, eat like spinnage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having got ten or twelve small spars to make
studding sail booms, boats’-masts, &amp;c., and night
approaching, we returned with them on board.</p>

<p class='c000'>The purpose for which I anchored under this isle
being answered, I was now to consider what was
next to be done. We had, from the topmast head,
taken a view of the sea around us, and observed the
whole, to the west, to be strewed with small islets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>sand-banks, and breakers, to the utmost extent of our
horizon. They seemed, indeed, not to be all connected,
and to be divided by winding channels. But
when I considered, that the extent of this S.&nbsp;W. coast
was already pretty well determined; the great risk
attending a more accurate survey, and the time it
would require to accomplish it, on account of the
many dangers we should have to encounter, I determined
not to hazard the ship down to leeward,
where we might be so hemmed in as to find it difficult
to return, and by that means lose the proper season
for getting to the south. I now wished to have had
the little vessel set up, the frame of which we had on
board. I had some thoughts of doing this when we
were last at Otaheite, but found it could not be executed,
without neglecting the caulking and other
necessary repairs of the ship, or staying longer there
than the route I had in view would admit. It was
now too late to begin setting her up, and then to
use her in exploring this coast; and in our voyage to
the south, she could be of no service. These reasons
induced me to try to get without the shoals; that is,
to the southward of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning, at day-break, we got under sail,
with a light breeze at E. by N. We had to make
some trips to weather the shoals to leeward of
Botany Isle; but when this was done, the breeze
began to fail; and at three P.&nbsp;M. it fell calm. The
swell, assisted by the current, set us fast to S.&nbsp;W.
towards the breakers, which were yet in sight in that
direction. Thus we continued till ten o’clock, at
which time a breeze springing up at N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. we
steered E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., the contrary course we had come in;
not daring to steer farther south till day-light.</p>

<p class='c000'>At three o’clock next morning, the wind veered to
S.&nbsp;W., blew hard, and in squalls, attended with rain,
which made it necessary to proceed with our courses
up, and topsails on the cap, till day-break, when the
hill on the Isle of Pines bore N., and our distance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>from the shore in that direction was about four
leagues. We had now a very strong wind at S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W.,
attended by a great sea, so that we had reason to
rejoice at having got clear of the shoals before this
gale overtook us. Though every thing conspired to
make me think this was the westerly monsoon, it can
hardly be comprehended under that name, for several
reasons; first, because it was near a month too soon
for these winds; secondly, because we know not if
they reach this place at all; and lastly, because it is
very common for westerly winds to blow within the
tropics. However, I never found them to blow so
hard before, or so far southerly. Be these things as
they may, we had now no other choice but to stretch
to S.&nbsp;E., which we accordingly did, with our starboard
tacks aboard; and at noon were out of sight of land.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gale continued with very little alteration till
noon next day; at which time we observed in latitude
23° 18ʹ, longitude made from the Isle of Pines 1° 54ʹ
East. In the afternoon we had little wind from the
south, and a great swell from the same direction; and
many boobies, tropic, and men-of-war birds were
seen. At eleven o’clock a fresh breeze sprung up
at W. by S., with which we stood to the south. At
this time we were in the latitude of 23° 18ʹ, longitude
169° 49ʹ E., and about forty-two leagues south of the
Hebrides.</p>

<p class='c000'>At eight o’clock in the morning, on the 3d, the
wind veered to S.&nbsp;W., and blew a strong gale by
squalls, attended with rain. I now gave over all
thought of returning to the land we had left. Indeed,
when I considered the vast ocean we had to explore
to the south; the state and condition of the
ship, already in want of some necessary stores; that
summer was approaching fast; and that any considerable
accident might detain us in this sea another
year; I did not think it advisable to attempt to regain
the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus I was obliged, as it were by necessity, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the first time, to leave a coast I had discovered, before
it was fully explored. I called it New Caledonia;
and, if we except New Zealand, it is perhaps
the largest island in the South Pacific Ocean; for
it extends from the latitude of 19° 37ʹ to 22° 30ʹ S.,
and from the longitude of 163° 37ʹ to 167° 14ʹ E. It
lies nearly N.&nbsp;W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W., and S.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E., and is about
eighty-seven leagues long in that direction; but its
breadth is not considerable, not any where exceeding
ten leagues. It is a country full of hills and valleys, of
various extent both for height and depth. To judge
of the whole by the parts we were on, from these
hills spring vast numbers of little rivulets, which
greatly contribute to fertilize the plains, and to supply
all the wants of the inhabitants. The summits
of most of the hills seem to be barren; though some
few are clothed with wood; as are all the plains and
valleys. By reason of these hills, many parts of the
coast, when at a distance from it, appeared indented,
or to have great inlets between the hills; but, when
we came near the shore, we always found such places
shut up with low land, and also observed low land to
lie along the coast between the sea-shore and the foot
of the hills. As this was the case in all such parts
as we came near enough to see, it is reasonable to
suppose that the whole coast is so. I am likewise of
opinion, that the whole, or greatest part, is surrounded
by reefs or shoals, which render the access
to it very dangerous, but at the same time guard the
coast from the violence of the wind and sea; make
it abound with fish; secure an easy and safe navigation
along it, for canoes, &amp;c. and most likely form
some good harbours for shipping. Most, if not every
part of the coast is inhabited, the Isle of Pines not
excepted; for we saw either smoke by day, or fires
by night, wherever we came. In the extent which I
have given to this island is included the broken or
unconnected lands to the N.&nbsp;W., as they are delineated
in the chart. That they may be connected, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>shall not pretend to deny; we were however of opinion
that they were isles, and that New Caledonia
terminated more to S.&nbsp;E., though this, at most, is but
a well-founded conjecture.</p>

<p class='c000'>But whether these lands be separate isles, or connected
with New Caledonia, it is by no means certain
that we saw their termination to the west. I
think we did not, as the shoals did not end with the
land we saw, but kept their N.&nbsp;W. direction farther
than Bougainville’s track in the latitude of 15° or
<span class='nobreak'>15<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>°.</span>
Nay, it seems not improbable, that a chain
of isles, sand-banks, and reefs, may extend to the
west, as far as the coast of New South Wales. The
eastern extent of the isles and shoals off that coast,
between the latitude of 15° and 23°, were not known.
The semblance of the two countries;<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c009'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Bougainville’s
meeting with the shoal of Diana above sixty leagues
from the coast, and the signs he had of land to the
S.&nbsp;E., all tend to increase the probability. I must
confess that it is carrying probability and conjecture
a little too far, to say what may lie in a space of two
hundred leagues; but it is in some measure necessary,
were it only to put some future navigator on
his guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Wales determined the longitude of that part
of New Caledonia we explored, by ninety-six sets
of observations, which were reduced to one another
by our trusty guide the watch. I found the variation
of the compass to be 10° 24ʹ E. This is the mean
variation given by the three azimuth compasses we had
on board, which would differ from each other a degree
and a half, and sometimes more. I did not observe
any difference in the variation between the N.&nbsp;W. and
S.&nbsp;E. parts of this land, except when we were at
anchor before Balade, where it was less than 10°;
but this I did not regard, as I found such an uniformity
out at sea; and it is there where navigators
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>want to know the variation. While we were on the
N.&nbsp;E. coast, I thought the currents set to S.&nbsp;E.
and W. or N.&nbsp;W. on the other side; but they are by
no means considerable, and may as probably be
channels of tides as regular currents. In the narrow
channels which divide the shoals, and those which
communicate with the sea, the tides run strong; but
their rise and fall are inconsiderable, not exceeding
three feet and a half. The time of high water, at
the full and change, at Balade, is about six o’clock;
but at Botany Isle we judged it would happen about
ten or eleven o’clock.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>The wind continuing at S.&nbsp;W., W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. and W.
blowing a fresh gale, and now and then squalls,
with showers of rain, we steered to S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., without
meeting with any remarkable occurrence till near
noon on the 6th, when it fell calm. At this time we
were in the latitude of 27° 50ʹ S., longitude 171° 43ʹ
E. The calm continued till noon the next day, during
which time we observed the variation to be 10°
<span class='nobreak'>33<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>ʹ</span>
E. I now ordered the carpenters to work to caulk
the decks. As we had neither pitch, tar, nor rosin,
left to pay the seams, this was done with varnish of
pine, and afterwards covered with coral sand, which
made a cement far exceeding my expectation. In
the afternoon, we had a boat in the water, and shot
two albatrosses, which were geese to us. We had
seen one of this kind of birds the day before, which
was the first we observed since we had been within
the tropic. On the 7th, at one P.&nbsp;M., a breeze
sprung up at south; soon after it veered to, and fixed
at S.&nbsp;E. by S., and blew a gentle gale, attended with
pleasant weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>We stretched to W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W., and next day at noon
were in the latitude of 28° 25ʹ, longitude 170° 26ʹ E.
In the evening, Mr. Cooper having struck a porpoise
with a harpoon, it was necessary to bring to, and
have two boats out, before we could kill it, and get
it on board. It was six feet long; a female of that
kind, which naturalists call dolphin of the antients,
and which differs from the other kind of porpoise in
the head and jaw, having them long and pointed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>This had eighty-eight teeth in each jaw. The haslet
and lean flesh were to us a feast. The latter was a
little liverish, but had not the least fishy taste. It
was eaten roasted, broiled, and fried, first soaking
it in warm water. Indeed little art was wanting to
make any thing fresh, palatable to those who had
been living so long on salt meat.</p>

<p class='c000'>We continued to stretch to W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. till the 10th,
when, at day-break, we discovered land bearing
S.&nbsp;W., which on a nearer approach we found to be
an island of good height, and five leagues in circuit.
I named it Norfolk Isle, in honour of the noble family
of Howard. It is situated in the latitude of
29° 2ʹ 30ʺ S., and longitude 168° 16ʹ E. The latter
was determined by lunar observations made on this,
the preceding, and following days; and the former,
by a good observation at noon, when we were about
three miles from the isle. Soon after we discovered
the isle we sounded in twenty-two fathoms on a bank
of coral sand; after this we continued to sound, and
found not less than twenty-two, or more than twenty-four
fathoms (except near the shore), and the
same bottom mixed with broken shells. After dinner,
a party of us embarked in two boats, and landed
on the island, without any difficulty, behind some
large rocks which lined part of the coast on the N.&nbsp;E.
side.</p>

<p class='c000'>We found it uninhabited, and were undoubtedly
the first that ever set foot on it. We observed many
trees and plants common at New Zealand; and, in
particular, the flax plant, which is rather more luxuriant
here than in any part of that country; but the
chief produce is a sort of spruce pine, which grows
in great abundance, and to a large size, many of the
trees being as thick, breast high, as two men could
fathom, and exceedingly straight and tall. This pine
is of a sort between that which grows in New Zealand
and that in New Caledonia; the foliage differing
something from both; and the wood not so heavy as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>the former, nor so light and close-grained as the latter.
It is a good deal like the Quebec pine. For
about two hundred yards from the shore the ground
is covered so thick with shrubs and plants, as hardly
to be penetrated farther inland. The woods were
perfectly clear and free from underwood, and the soil
seemed rich and deep.</p>

<p class='c000'>We found the same kind of pigeons, parrots, and
paroquets as in New Zealand, rails, and some small
birds. The sea fowl are, white boobies, gulls, tern,
&amp;c. which breed undisturbed on the shores, and in
the cliffs of the rocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the isle is fresh water; and cabbage-palm,
wood-sorrel, sow thistle, and samphire abounding in
some places on the shores; we brought on board as
much of each sort as the time we had to gather them
would admit. These cabbage-trees, or palms, were not
thicker than a man’s leg, and from ten to twenty feet
high. They are of the same genus with the cocoa-nut
tree; like it, they have large pinnated leaves, and
are the same as the second sort found in the northern
parts of New South Wales.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c009'><sup>[13]</sup></a> The cabbage is, properly
speaking, the bud of the tree; each tree producing
but one cabbage, which is at the crown, where
the leaves spring out, and is inclosed in the stem. The
cutting off the cabbage effectually destroys the tree;
so that no more than one can be had from the same
stem. The cocoa-nut tree, and some others of the
palm kind, produce cabbage as well as these. This
vegetable is not only wholesome, but exceedingly
palatable, and proved the most agreeable repast we
had for some time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coast does not want fish. While we were on
shore, the people in the boats caught some which
were excellent. I judged that it was high water at
the full and change, about one o’clock, and that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>tide rises and falls upon a perpendicular about four
or five feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The approach of night brought us all on board,
when we hoisted in the boats; and stretching to
E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. (with the wind at S.&nbsp;E.) till midnight, we
tacked, and spent the remainder of the night making
short boards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning, at sun-rise, we made sail, stretching
to S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W., and weathered the island, on the south
side of which lie two isles, that serve as roosting and
breeding-places for birds. On this, as also on the
S.&nbsp;E. side, is a sandy beach; whereas most of the
other shores are bounded by rocky cliffs which have
twenty and eighteen fathoms water close to them; at
least so we found it on the N.&nbsp;E. side, and with good
anchorage. A bank of coral sand, mixed with shells,
on which we found from nineteen to thirty-five or
forty fathoms water, surrounds the isle, and extends,
especially to the south, seven leagues off. The morning
we discovered the island the variation was found
to be 13° 9ʹ E.; but I think this observation gave too
much, as others, which we had both before and after,
gave 2° less.</p>

<p class='c000'>After leaving Norfolk Isle, I steered for New Zealand,
my intention being to touch at Queen Charlotte’s
Sound, to refresh my crew, and put the ship
in a condition to encounter the southern latitudes.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 17th, at day-break, we saw Mount Egmont,
which was covered with everlasting snow,
bearing S.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E. Our distance from the shore
was about eight leagues, and, on sounding, we found
seventy fathoms water, a muddy bottom. The wind
soon fixed in the western board, and blew a fresh
gale, with which we steered S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. for Queen
Charlotte’s Sound, with a view of falling in with
Cape Stephens. At noon Cape Egmont bore E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E., distant three or four leagues; and though the
mount was hid in the clouds, we judged it to be in the
same direction as the Cape; latitude observed 39° 24ʹ.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>The wind increased in such a manner as to oblige us
to close reef our top-sails, and strike top-gallant yards.
At last we could bear no more sail than the two
courses, and two close-reefed top-sails; and under
them we stretched for Cape Stephens, which we
made at eleven o’clock at night.</p>

<p class='c000'>At midnight we tacked, and made a trip to the
north till three o’clock next morning, when we bore
away for the sound. At nine we hauled round Point
Jackson, through a sea which looked terrible, occasioned
by a rapid tide and a high wind; but as we
knew the coast, it did not alarm us. At eleven
o’clock we anchored before Ship Cove; the strong
flurries from off the land not permitting us to get in.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the afternoon, as we could not move the ship,
I went into the cove, with the seine, to try to catch
some fish. The first thing I did after landing was
to look for the bottle I left hid when last here, in
which was the memorandum. It was taken away;
but by whom it did not appear. Two hauls with the
seine producing only four small fish, we, in some
measure, made up for this deficiency, by shooting
several birds, which the flowers in the garden had
drawn thither, as also some old shags, and by robbing
the nests of some young ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being little wind next morning, we weighed, and
warped the ship into the Cove, and there moored
with the two bowers. We unbent the sails to repair
them, several having been split, and otherwise damaged
in the late gale. The main and four courses,
already worn to the very utmost, were condemned as
useless. I ordered the top-masts to be struck and
unrigged, in order to fix to them moveable chocks
or knees, for want of which the trestle-trees were
continually breaking; the forge to be set up, to make
bolts and repair our iron-work; and tents to be erected
on shore for the reception of a guard, coopers,
sail-makers, &amp;c. I likewise gave orders that vegetables
(of which there were plenty) should be boiled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>every morning with oat-meal and portable broth for
breakfast, and with peas and broth every day for
dinner for the whole crew, over and above their usual
allowance of salt malt.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the afternoon, as Mr. Wales was setting up his
observatory, he discovered that several trees, which
were standing when we last sailed from this place,
had been cut down with saws and axes; and a few
days after, the place where an observatory, clock,
&amp;c. had been set up, was also found, in a spot different
from that where Mr. Wales had placed his. It
was therefore now no longer to be doubted that the
Adventure had been in this cove after we had left it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next day, winds southerly, hazy cloudy weather.
Every body went to work at their respective employments,
one of which was to caulk the ship’s sides, a
thing much wanted. The seams were paid with putty,
made with cook’s fat and chalk; the gunner happening
to have a quantity of the latter on board.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 21st, wind southerly, with continual rains.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weather being fair in the afternoon of the
22d, accompanied by the botanists, I visited our gardens
on Motuara, which we found almost in a state
of nature, having been wholly neglected by the inhabitants.
Nevertheless, many articles were in a
flourishing condition, and showed how well they liked
the soil in which they were planted. None of the
natives having yet made their appearance, we made
a fire on the point of the island; in hopes, if they
saw the smoke, they might be induced to come to us.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing remarkable happened till the 24th, when,
in the morning, two canoes were seen coming down
the sound; but as soon as they perceived the ship,
they retired behind a point on the west side. After
breakfast I went in a boat to look for them; and as
we proceeded along the shore, we shot several birds.
The report of the muskets gave notice of our approach,
and the natives discovered themselves in
Shag Cove by hallooing to us; but as we drew near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>to their habitations, they all fled to the woods, except
two or three men, who stood on a rising ground
near the shore, with their arms in their hands. The
moment we landed, they knew us. Joy then took
place of fear, and the rest of the natives hurried out
of the woods, and embraced us over and over again,
leaping and skipping about like madmen; but I observed
that they would not suffer some women, whom
we saw at a distance, to come near us. After we
had made them presents of hatchets, knives, and
what else we had with us, they gave us in return a
large quantity of fish, which they had just caught.
There were only a few amongst them whose faces we
could recognise; and on our asking why they were
afraid of us, and inquiring for some of our old acquaintances
by name, they talked much about killing,
which was so variously understood by us, that we
could gather nothing from it; so that, after a short
stay, we took leave, and went on board.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning early, our friends, according to a
promise they made us the preceding evening, paying
us a visit, brought with them a quantity of fine fish,
which they exchanged for Otaheitean cloth, &amp;c. and
then returned to their habitations.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 26th we got into the after-hold four boatload
of shingle ballast, and struck down six guns,
keeping only six on deck. Our good friends the
natives having brought us a plentiful supply of fish,
afterwards went on shore to the tents, and informed
our people there, that a ship like ours had been
lately lost in the Strait; that some of the people got
on shore; and that the natives stole their clothes,
&amp;c. for which several were shot; that afterwards,
when they could fire no longer, the natives having
got the better, killed them with their <i>Patapatoos</i>, and
eat them; but that they themselves had no hand in
the affair, which, they said, happened at Vanna
Aroa, near Teerawhitte, on the other side of the
Strait. One man said it was two moons ago; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>another contradicted him, and counted on his fingers
about twenty or thirty days. They described by
actions how the ship was beat to pieces, by going
up and down against the rocks, till at last it was
all scattered abroad.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day some others told the same story,
or nearly to the same purport, and pointed over the
East Bay, which is on the east side of the sound, as
to the place where it happened. These stories
making me very uneasy about the Adventure, I desired
Mr. Wales, and those on shore, to let me know
if any of the natives should mention it again, or to
send them to me; for I had not heard any thing
from them myself. When Mr. Wales came on board
to dinner, he found the very people who had told him
the story on shore, and pointed them out to me. I
inquired about the affair, and endeavoured to come
at the truth by every method I could think of. All
I could get from them was, <i>Caurey</i> (no); and they
not only denied every syllable of what they had said
on shore, but seemed wholly ignorant of the matter;
so that I began to think our people had misunderstood
them, and that the story referred to some of
their own people and boats.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 28th, fresh gales westerly, and fair weather.
We rigged and fitted the top-masts. Having
gone on a shooting-party to West Bay, we went to
the place where I left the hogs and fowls; but
saw no vestiges of them, nor of any body having
been there since. In our return, having visited the
natives, we got some fish in exchange for trifles
which we gave them. As we were coming away,
Mr. Forster thought he heard the squeaking of a pig in
the woods, close by their habitations; probably, they
may have those I left with them when last here. In
the evening we got on board, with about a dozen
and an half of wild fowl, shags, and sea-pies. The
sportsmen who had been out in the woods near the
ship, were more successful among the small birds.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>On the 29th and 30th nothing remarkable happened,
except that in the evening of the latter all the
natives left us.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 31st being a fine pleasant day, our botanists
went over to Long Island, where one of the party
saw a large black boar. As it was described to me,
I thought it to be one of those which Captain Furneaux
left behind, and had been brought over to this
isle by those who had it in keeping. Since they did
not destroy those hogs when first in their possession,
we cannot suppose they will do it now; so that there
is little fear but that this country will, in time, be
stocked with these animals, both in a wild and domestic
state.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next day we were visited by a number of strangers,
who came from up the sound, and brought
with them but little fish. Their chief commodity was
green stone or talc, an article which never came to a
bad market; and some of the largest pieces of it I had
ever seen were got this day.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 2d I went over to the east side of the
sound, and, without meeting any thing remarkable,
returned on board in the evening, when I learnt that
the same people who visited us the preceding day
had been on board most of this, with their usual
article of trade.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 3d, Mr. Pickersgill met with some of the
natives, who related to him the story of a ship being
lost, and the people being killed; but added, with
great earnestness, it was not done by them.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 4th fine pleasant weather. Most of the
natives now retired up the sound. Indeed, I had
taken every gentle method to oblige them to be gone;
for since these new-comers had been with us, our
old friends had disappeared, and we had been without
fish. Having gone over to Long Island to
look for the hog which had been seen there, I
found it to be one of the sows left by Captain Furneaux;
the same that was in possession of the natives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>when we were last here. From a supposition of its
being a boar, I had carried over a sow to leave with
him; but on seeing my mistake, brought her back,
as the leaving her there would answer no end.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the morning of the 5th, our old friends
made us a visit, and brought a seasonable supply of
fish. At the same time I embarked in the pinnace
with Messrs. Forsters and Sparrman, in order to proceed
up the sound. I was desirous of finding the termination
of it; or rather, of seeing if I could find any
passage out to sea by the S.&nbsp;E., as I suspected from some
discoveries I had made when first here. In our way
up we met with some fishers, of whom we made the
necessary inquiry; and they all agreed that there
was no passage to sea by the head of the sound. As
we proceeded, we some time after met a canoe, conducted
by four men, coming down the sound. These
confirmed what the others had said, in regard to there
being no passage to sea the way we were going; but
gave us to understand that there was one to the east,
in the very place where I expected to find it. I now
laid aside the scheme of going to the head of the
sound, and proceeded to this arm, which is on the
S.&nbsp;E. side, about four or five leagues above the Isle of
Motuara.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little within the entrance on the S.&nbsp;E. side, at a
place called Kotieghenooee, we found a large settlement
of the natives. The chief; whose name was
Tringo-boohee, and his people, whom we found to
be some of those who had lately been on board the
ship, received us with great courtesy. They seemed
to be pretty numerous both here and in the neighbourhood.
Our stay with them was short, as the information
they gave us encouraged us to pursue the object
we had in view. Accordingly, we proceeded
down the arm E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. and E. by N., leaving several
fine coves on both sides, and at last found it to open
into the strait by a channel about a mile wide, in
which ran out a strong tide; having also observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>one setting down the arm, all the time we had been
in it. It was now about four o’clock in the afternoon;
and in less than an hour after, this tide ceased,
and was succeeded by the flood, which came in with
equal strength.</p>

<p class='c000'>The outlet lies S.&nbsp;E. by E., and N.&nbsp;W. by W., and
nearly in the direction of E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., and W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W.
from Cape Terrawhitte. We found thirteen fathoms
water a little within the entrance, clear
ground. It seemed to me that a leading wind was
necessary to go in and out of this passage, on account
of the rapidity of the tides. I, however, had
but little time to make observations of this nature, as
night was at hand, and I had resolved to return on
board. On that account, I omitted visiting a large
<i>hippa</i>, or strong-hold, built on an elevation on the
north side, and about a mile or two within the entrance.
The inhabitants of it, by signs, invited us
to go to them; but, without paying any regard to
them, we proceeded directly for the ship, which we
reached by ten o’clock, bringing with us some fish we
had got from the natives, and a few birds we had shot.
Amongst the latter, were some of the same kind of
ducks we found in Dusky Bay; and we have reason
to believe that they are all to be met with here. For
the natives knew them all by the drawings, and had a
particular name for each.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 6th, wind at N.&nbsp;E., gloomy weather with
rain. Our old friends having taken up their abode
near us, one of them, whose name was Pedero, (a
man of some note,) made me a present of a staff of
honour, such as the chiefs generally carry. In return,
I dressed him in a suit of old clothes, of which
he was not a little proud. He had a fine person
and a good presence; and nothing but his colour distinguished
him from an European. Having got him
and another into a communicative mood, we began
to enquire of them if the Adventure had been there
during my absence, and they gave us to understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>in a manner that admitted of no doubt, that soon
after we were gone she arrived, that she staid between
ten and twenty days, and had been gone ten
months. They likewise asserted, that neither she
nor any other ship had been stranded on the coast,
as had been reported. This assertion, and the manner
in which they related the coming and going of
the Adventure, made me easy about her; but did
not wholly set aside our suspicions of a disaster having
happened to some other strangers. Besides
what has been already related, we had been told
that a ship had lately been here, and was gone to a
place called Terato, which is on the north side of the
Strait. Whether this story related to the former or
no, I cannot say. Whenever I questioned the natives
about it, they always denied all knowledge of it; and
for some time past had avoided mentioning it. It
was but a few days before, that one man received a
box on the ear for naming it to some of our people.</p>

<p class='c000'>After breakfast, I took a number of hands over to
Long-Island, in order to catch the sow, to put her
to the boar, and remove her to some other place;
but we returned without seeing her. Some of the
natives had been there not long before us, as their
fires were yet burning; and they had undoubtedly
taken her away. Pedero dined with us, ate of every
thing at table, and drank more wine than any one
of us, without being in the least affected by it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 7th, fresh gales at N.&nbsp;E. with continual rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 8th, fore-part rain, remainder fair weather.
We put two pigs, a boar and a sow, on shore, in the
cove next without Cannibal Cove; so that it is hardly
possible all the methods I have taken to stock this
country with these animals should fail. We had also
reason to believe that some of the cocks and hens
which I left here still existed, although we had not
seen any of them; for an hen’s egg was, some days
before, found in the woods almost new laid.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 9th, wind westerly or N.&nbsp;W. squally, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>rain. In the morning we unmoored, and shifted our
birth farther out of the cove, for the more ready getting
to sea the next morning; for, at present, the
caulkers had not finished the sides, and till this work
was done we could not sail. Our friends having
brought us a very large and seasonable supply of fish,
I bestowed on Pedero a present of an empty oil-jar,
which made him as happy as a prince. Soon after,
he and his party left the cove, and retired to their
proper place of abode, with all the treasure they had
received from us. I believe that they gave away
many of the things they, at different times, got from
us, to their friends, and neighbours, or else parted
with them to purchase peace of their more powerful
enemies; for we never saw any of our presents after
they were once in their possession; and every time we
visited them they were as much in want of hatchets,
nails, &amp;c. to all appearance, as if they never had had
any among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am satisfied that the people in this Sound, who
are, upon the whole, pretty numerous, are under no
regular form of government, or so united as to form
one body politic. The head of each tribe, or family,
seems to be respected; and that respect may, on
some occasions, command obedience; but I doubt if
any amongst them have either a right or power to
enforce it. The day we were with Tringo-boohee,
the people came from all parts to see us, which he
endeavoured to prevent. But though he went so far
as to throw stones at some, I observed that very few
paid any regard either to his words or actions; and
yet this man was spoken of as a chief of some note.
I have, before, made some remarks on the evils attending
these people for want of union among themselves;
and the more I was acquainted with them,
the more I found it to be so. Notwithstanding they
are cannibals, they are naturally of a good disposition,
and have not a little humanity.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>In the afternoon a party of us went ashore into one
of the coves, where were two families of the natives
variously employed; some sleeping, some making
mats, others roasting fish and fir roots, and one girl,
I observed, was heating of stones. Curious to know
what they were for, I remained near her. As soon
as the stones were made hot, she took them out of the
fire, and gave them to an old woman, who was sitting
in the hut. <em>She</em> placed them in a heap, laid over
them a handful of green celery, and over that a coarse
mat, and then squatted herself down, on her heels,
on the top of all; thus making a kind of Dutch warming-pan,
on which she sat as close as a hare on her
seat. I should hardly have mentioned this operation,
if I had thought it had no other view than to warm
the old woman’s backside. I rather suppose it was
intended to cure some disorder she might have on
her, which the steams arising from the green celery
might be a specific for. I was led to think so by
there being hardly any celery in the place, we having
gathered it long before; and grass, of which there
was great plenty, would have kept the stones from
burning the mat full as well, if that had been all that
was meant. Besides, the woman looked to me sickly,
and not in a good state of health.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Wales from time to time communicated to me
the observations he had made in this Sound for determining
the longitude, the mean results of which
give 174° 25ʹ 7ʺ
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E. for the bottom of Ship Cove,
where the observations were made; and the latitude
of it is 41° 5ʹ 56ʺ
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
S. In my chart, constituted
in my former voyage, this place is laid down in
184° 54ʹ 30ʺ West, equal to 175° 5ʹ 30ʺ E. The
error of the chart is therefore, 0° 40ʹ 0ʺ, and nearly
equal to what was found at Dusky Bay; by which it
appears that the whole of Tavai-poenammoo is laid
down 40ʹ too far east in the said chart, as well as in
the journal of the voyage. But the error in Eaheino-mauwe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>is not more than half a degree, or thirty
minutes; because the distance between Queen Charlotte’s
Sound and Cape Palliser has been found to be
greater by 10ʹ of longitude than it is laid down in the
chart. I mention these errors, not from a fear that
they will affect either navigation or geography, but
because I have no doubt of their existence; for, from
the multitude of observations which Mr. Wales took,
the situation of few parts of the world is better ascertained
than Queen Charlotte’s Sound. Indeed, I
might, with equal truth, say the same of all the other
places where we made any stay; for Mr. Wales,
whose abilities are equal to his assiduity, lost no one
observation that could possibly be obtained. Even
the situation of those islands which we passed without
touching at them, is, by means of Kendal’s watch,
determined with almost equal accuracy. The error
of the watch from Otaheite to this place was only
43ʹ 39ʺ
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span>
in longitude, reckoning at the rate it was
found to go at, at that island and at Tanna; but by
reckoning at the rate it was going when last at Queen
Charlotte’s Sound, and from the time of our leaving
it, to our return to it again, which was near a year,
the error was 19ʹ 31ʺ, 25 in time, or 4° 52ʹ 48ʺ
<span class='nobreak'><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span>
in
longitude. This error cannot be thought great, if we
consider the length of time, and that we had gone
over a space equal to upwards of three-fourths of the
equatorial circumference of the earth, and through
all the climates and latitudes from 9° to 71°. Mr.
Wales found its rate of going here to be that of gaining
12ʺ, 576, on mean time, per day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mean result of all the observations he made
for ascertaining the variation of the compass and the
dip of the south end of the needle, the three several
times we had been here, gave 14° 9ʹ
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>5</sub></span>
E. for the former,
and 64° 36ʺ
<span class='nobreak'><sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub></span>
for the latter. He also found,
from very accurate observations, that the time of
high-water preceded the moon’s southing, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>full and change days, by three hours; and that the
greatest rise and fall of the water was five feet ten
inches and a half; but there were evident tokens on
the beach of its having risen two feet higher than it
ever did in the course of his experiments.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>At daybreak on the 10th, with a fine breeze at
W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W., we weighed and stood out of the Sound;
and, after getting round the Two Brothers, steered
for Cape Campbell, which is at the S.&nbsp;W. entrance
of the Strait, all sails set, with a fine breeze at north.
At four in the afternoon, we passed the Cape, at the
distance of four or five leagues, and then steered
S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E. with the wind at N.&nbsp;W. a gentle gale, and
cloudy weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning, the wind veered round by the west
to south, and forced us more to the east than I intended.
At seven o’clock in the evening, the snowy
mountains bore W. by S., and Cape Palliser N.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W.
distant sixteen or seventeen leagues; from which
Cape I for the third time took my departure. After a
few hours’ calm, a breeze springing up at north, we
steered S. by E. all sails set, with a view of getting
into the latitude of 54° or 55°; my intention being to
cross this vast ocean nearly in these parallels, and so
as to pass over those parts which were left unexplored
the preceding summer.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the morning of the 12th, the wind increased to
a fine gale: at noon we observed in latitude 43° 13ʹ 30ʺ
S., longitude 176° 41ʹ E., an extraordinary fish of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>whale kind was seen, which some called a sea-monster.
I did not see it myself. In the afternoon, our old
companions the pintado peterels began to appear.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 13th, in the morning, the wind veered to
W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. At seven, seeing the appearance of land
to the S.&nbsp;W. we hauled up towards it, and soon found
it to be a <a id='fog'></a>fog-bank. Afterwards we steered S.&nbsp;E. by
S. and soon after saw a seal. At noon, latitude, by
account, 44° 25ʹ, longitude 177° 31ʹ E. Foggy
weather, which continued all the afternoon. At six
in the evening, the wind veered to N.&nbsp;E. by N. and
increased to a fresh gale, attended with thick hazy
weather; course steered E.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span>
S.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 14th, A.&nbsp;M., saw another seal. At noon,
latitude 45° 54ʹ, longitude 179° 29ʹ E.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 15th, A.&nbsp;M., the wind veered to the westward;
the fog cleared away, but the weather continued
cloudy. At noon, latitude 47° 30ʹ, longitude
178° 19ʹ W.; for, having passed the meridian of
180° E., I now reckon my longitude west of the first
meridian, viz. Greenwich. In the evening heard penguins,
and the next morning saw some sea or rock
weed. At noon a fresh gale from the west and fine
weather. Latitude observed 49° 33ʹ, longitude
175° 31ʹ W.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning fresh gales and hazy weather; saw
a seal and several pieces of weed. At noon, latitude
51° 12ʹ, longitude 173° 17ʹ W. The wind veered
to the north and N.&nbsp;E. by N., blew a strong gale by
squalls, which split an old topgallant sail, and obliged
us to double-reef the topsails; but in the evening
the wind moderated, and veered to W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. when
we loosed a reef out of each topsail, and found the
variation of the compass to be 9° 52ʹ E., being then
in the latitude 51° 47ʹ, longitude 172° 21ʹ W.; and
the next morning, the 18th, in the latitude of 52° 25ʹ,
longitude 170° 45ʹ W., it was 10° 26ʹ E. Towards
noon, had moderate but cloudy weather, and a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>swell from the west: some penguins and pieces of
sea-weed seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 19th, steered E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. with a very fresh gale
at N., hazy, dirty weather. At noon, latitude 53° 43ʹ,
longitude 166° 15ʹ W.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 20th, steered E. by S. with a moderate
breeze at N. attended with thick hazy weather. At
noon, latitude 54° 8ʹ, longitude 162° 18ʹ W.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 21st, winds mostly from the N.&nbsp;E. a fresh
gale attended with thick, hazy, dirty weather. Course
S.&nbsp;E. by S., latitude, at noon, 55° 31ʹ, longitude
160° 29ʹ W.; abundance of blue peterels and some
penguins seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fresh gales at N.&nbsp;W. by N. and N. by W., and hazy
till towards noon of the 22d, when the weather cleared
up, and we observed in latitude 55° 48ʹ S., longitude
156° 56ʹ W. In the afternoon had a few hours’ calm;
after that, the wind came at S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. and S.&nbsp;E. by S.
a light breeze, with which we steered east northerly.
In the night the aurora australis was visible, but very
faint, and no ways remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 23d, in the latitude of 55° 46ʹ S., longitude
156° 13ʹ W., the variation was 9° 42ʹ E. We had a
calm from ten in the morning till six in the evening,
when a breeze sprung up at west; at first it blew a
gentle gale, but afterwards freshened. Our course
was now E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
N.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 24th, a fresh breeze at N.&nbsp;W. by W. and
N. by W. At noon, in latitude 55° 38ʹ S., longitude
153° 37ʹ W., foggy in the night, but next day had
a fine gale at N.&nbsp;W. attended with clear pleasant
weather; course steered E. by N. In the evening,
being in the latitude of 55° 8ʹ S., longitude 148° 10ʹ
W. the variation, by the mean of two compasses, was
6° 35ʹ
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having a steady fresh gale at N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. on the 26th
and 27th, we steered east, and at noon, on the latter,
were in latitude 55° 6ʹ S., longitude 138° 56ʹ W.</p>

<p class='c000'>I now gave up all hopes of finding any more land
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>in this ocean, and came to a resolution to steer directly
for the west entrance of the Straits of Magalhaens,
with a view of coasting the out or south side
of Terra del Fuego, round Cape Horn, to the Strait
le Maire. As the world has but a very imperfect
knowledge of this shore, I thought the coasting of it
would be of more advantage, both to navigation and
to geography, than any thing I could expect to find
in a higher latitude. In the afternoon of this day,
the wind blew in squalls, and carried away the main
topgallant mast.</p>

<p class='c000'>A very strong gale northerly, with hazy rainy
weather, on the 28th, obliged us to double-reef the
fore and main topsail, to hand the mizen topsail, and
get down the fore top-gallant yard. In the morning,
the bolt rope of the main topsail broke, and occasioned
the sail to be spilt. I have observed that the ropes
to all our sails, the square sails especially, are not of
a size and strength sufficient to wear out the canvass.
At noon, latitude 55° 20ʹ S., longitude 134° 16ʹ W.,
a great swell from N.&nbsp;W. albatrosses and blue peterels
seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next day towards noon, the wind abating, we
loosed all the reefs out of the topsails, rigged another
top-gallant mast, and got the yards across. P.&nbsp;M.
little wind, and hazy weather; at midnight calm,
that continued till noon the next day, when a breeze
sprung up at E. with which we stretched to the
northward. At this time we were in the latitude
55° 32ʹ S., longitude 128° 45ʹ W., some albatrosses
and peterels seen. At eight P.&nbsp;M. the wind veering
to N.&nbsp;E. we tacked and stood to E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 1st of December, thick hazy weather, with
drizzling rain, and a moderate breeze of wind, which
at three o’clock P.&nbsp;M. fell to a calm; at this time in
latitude 55° 41ʹ S., longitude 127° 5ʹ W. After four
hours’ calm, the fog cleared away, and we got a
wind at S.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;with which we stood N.&nbsp;E.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Next day, a fresh breeze at S.&nbsp;E. and hazy foggy
weather, except a few hours in the morning, when
we found the variation to be 1° 28ʹ E., latitude 55° 17ʹ,
longitude 125° 41ʹ W. The variation after this was
supposed to increase; for on the 4th, in the morning,
being in latitude 53° 21ʹ, longitude 121° 31ʹ W., it
was 3° 16ʹ E.; in the evening, in latitude 53° 13ʹ,
longitude 119° 46ʹ W. it was 3° 28ʹ E.; and on the
5th, at six o’clock in the evening, in latitude 53° 8ʹ,
longitude 115° 58ʹ W., it was 4° 1ʹ E.</p>

<p class='c000'>For more than twenty-four hours having had a fine
gale at S., this enabled us to steer E., with very little
deviation to the N.; and the wind now altering to
S.&nbsp;W. and blowing a steady fresh breeze, we continued
to steer E., inclining a little to S.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 6th, had some snow showers. In the
evening, being in latitude 53° 13ʹ, longitude 111° 12ʹ,
the variation was 4° 58ʹ E.; and the next morning,
being in latitude 58° 16ʹ, longitude 109° 33ʹ, it was
5° 1ʹ E.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind was now at W., a fine pleasant gale,
sometimes with showers of rain. Nothing remarkable
happened, till the 9th, at noon, when being in
the latitude of 53° 37ʹ, longitude 103° 44ʹ W., the
wind veered to N.&nbsp;E. and afterwards came insensibly
round to the S., by the E. and S.&nbsp;E. attended with
cloudy hazy weather, and some showers of rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 10th, a little before noon, latitude 54°,
longitude 102° 7ʹ W., passed a small bed of sea-weed.
In the afternoon the wind veered to S.&nbsp;W., blew a
fresh gale, attended with dark cloudy weather. We
steered E. half a point N.; and the next day, at six
in the evening, being in latitude 53° 35ʹ, longitude
95° 52ʹ W., the variation was 9° 58ʹ E. Many and
various sorts of albatrosses about the ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 12th, the wind veered to the W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. and
in the evening to N.; and, at last, left us to a calm.
That continued till midnight, when we got a breeze
at S.; which, soon after, veering to, and fixing at,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>W. we steered E.; and on the 14th, in the morning,
found the variation to be 13° 25ʹ E., latitude 53° 25ʹ,
longitude 87° 53ʹ W.; and in the afternoon, being in
the same latitude, and the longitude of 86° 2ʹ W. it
was 15° 3ʹ E., and increased in such a manner, that
on the 15th, in the latitude of 53° 30ʹ, longitude
82° 23ʹ W., it was 17° E.; and the next evening, in
the latitude of 53° 25ʹ, longitude 78° 40ʹ, it was
17° 38ʹ E. About this time, we saw a penguin and
a piece of weed; and the next morning, a seal and
some diving peterels. For the three last days, the
wind had been at W., a steady fresh gale, attended,
now and then, with showers of rain or hail.</p>

<p class='c000'>At six in the morning of the 17th, being nearly
in the same latitude as above, and in the longitude of
77° 10ʹ W., the variation was 18° 33ʹ E.; and in the
afternoon it was 21° 38ʹ, being at that time in latitude
53° 16ʹ S., longitude 75° 9ʹ W. In the morning, as
well as in the afternoon, I took some observations to
determine the longitude by the watch; and the
results, reduced to noon, gave 76° 18ʹ 30ʺ W. At
the same time, the longitude, by my reckoning, was
76° 17ʹ W. But I have reason to think, that we
were about half a degree more to the west than
either the one or the other; our latitude, at the same
time, was 53° 21ʹ S.</p>

<p class='c000'>We steered E. by N. and E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
N. all this day,
under all the sail we could carry, with a fine fresh
gale at N.&nbsp;W. by W. in expectation of seeing the
land before night; but not making it till ten o’clock,
we took in the studding-sails, top-gallant sails, and a
reef in each topsail, and steered E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. in order to
make sure of falling in with Cape Deseada.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two hours after, we made the land, extending
from N.&nbsp;E. by N. to E. by S. about six leagues distant.
On this discovery, we wore and brought to, with the
ship’s head to the S., and having sounded, found
seventy-five fathoms water, the bottom stone and
shells. The land now before us could be no other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>than the west coast of Terra del Fuego, and near the
west entrance to the Straits of Magalhaens.</p>

<p class='c000'>As this was the first run that had been made
directly across this ocean, in a high southern latitude<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c009'><sup>[14]</sup></a>,
I have been a little particular in noting every circumstance
that appeared in the least material; and
after all, I must observe that I never made a passage
any where of such length, or even much shorter,
where so few interesting circumstances occurred.
For, if I except the variation of the compass, I know
of nothing else worth notice. The weather had been
neither unusually stormy nor cold. Before we arrived
in the latitude of 50°, the mercury in the thermometer
fell gradually from sixty to fifty; and after
we arrived in the latitude of 55°, it was generally
between forty-seven and forty-five; once or twice it
fell to forty-three. These observations were made
at noon.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have now done with the Southern Pacific Ocean;
and flatter myself that no one will think that I have
left it unexplored; or that more could have been
done, in one voyage, towards obtaining that end,
than has been done in this.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after we left New Zealand, Mr. Wales contrived,
and fixed up an instrument, which very accurately
measured the angle the ship rolled, when
sailing large and in a great sea; and that in which
she lay down, when sailing upon a wind. The
greatest angle he observed her to roll was 38°. This
was on the 6th of this month, when the sea was not
unusually high; so that it cannot be reckoned the
greatest roll she had made. The most he observed
her to heel or lie down, when sailing upon a wind,
was 18°; and this was under double-reefed topsails
and courses.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 18th, at three in the morning, we sounded
again, and found one hundred and ten fathoms, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>same bottom as before. We now made sail with a
fresh gale at N.&nbsp;W. and steered S.&nbsp;E. by E. along the
coast. It extended from Cape Deseada, which bore
N. 7° E., to E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., a pretty high ragged isle, which
lies near a league from the main, and S. 18° E.
six leagues from Cape Deseada, bore N. 49° E.
distant four leagues; and it obtained the name of
Landfall. At four o’clock, we were north and south
of the high land of Cape Deseada, distant about nine
leagues; so that we saw none of the low rocks said to
lie off it. The latitude of this Cape is about 53° S.
longitude 74° 40ʹ W.</p>

<p class='c000'>Continuing to range the coast, at about two
leagues distance, at eleven o’clock we passed a projecting
point, which I called Cape Gloucester. It
shows a round surface of considerable height, and has
much the appearance of being an island. It lies
S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.,
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E., distant seventeen leagues from the Isle
of Landfall. The coast between them forms two
bays, strewed with rocky islets, rocks, and breakers.
The coast appeared very broken with many inlets; or
rather it seemed to be composed of a number of
islands. The land is very mountainous, rocky, and
barren, spotted, here and there, with tufts of wood,
and patches of snow. At noon Cape Gloucester bore
N. distant eight miles, and the most advanced point
of land to the S.&nbsp;E. which we judged to be Cape
Noir, bore S.&nbsp;E. by S. distant seven or eight leagues.
Latitude observed 54° 13ʹ S. Longitude made from
Cape Deseada, 54ʹ E. From Cape Gloucester, off
which lies a small rocky island, the direction of the
coast is nearly S.&nbsp;E.; but to Cape Noir, for which we
steered, the course is S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., distant about ten
leagues.</p>

<p class='c000'>At three o’clock, we passed Cape Noir, which is a
steep rock of considerable height, and the S.&nbsp;W. point
of a large island that seemed to lie detached a
league or a league and a half from the main land.
The land of the Cape, when at a distance from it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>appeared to be an island disjoined from the other;
but, on a nearer approach, we found it connected by
a low neck of land. At the point of the Cape are
two rocks; the one peaked like a sugar-loaf, the other
not so high, and showing a rounder surface; and
S. by E. two leagues from the Cape are two other
rocky islets. This Cape is situated in the latitude
of 54° 30ʹ S. longitude 73° 33ʹ W.</p>

<p class='c000'>After passing the two islets, we steered E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.
crossing the great bay of St. Barbara. We but just
saw the land in the bottom of it; which could not be
less than seven or eight leagues from us. There was
a space, lying in the direction of E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. from Cape
Noir, where no land was to be seen: this may be the
Channel of St. Barbara which opens into the Straits
of Magalhaens, as mentioned by Frezier. We found
the Cape to agree very well with his description;
which shows that he laid down the channel from good
memoirs. At ten o’clock, drawing near the S.&nbsp;E.
point of the bay, which lies nearly in the direction of
S. 60° E. from Cape Noir, eighteen leagues distant,
we shortened sail, and spent the night standing off
and on.</p>

<p class='c000'>At two o’clock in the morning of the 19th, having
made sail, we steered S.&nbsp;E. by E. along the coast, and
soon passed the S.&nbsp;E. point of the Bay of St. Barbara,
which I called Cape Desolation; because near it commenced
the most desolate and barren country I ever
saw. It is situated in the latitude of 54° 55ʹ S.,
longitude 72° 12ʹ W. About four leagues to the east
of this Cape is a deep inlet, at the entrance of which
lies a pretty large island, and some others of less note.
Nearly in this situation some charts place a channel
leading into the Straits of Magalhaens, under the
name of Straits of Jelouzel. At ten o’clock, being
about a league and a half from the land, we
sounded, and found sixty fathoms water, a bottom
of small stones and shells.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind, which had been fresh at N. by W. began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>to abate, and at noon it fell calm, when we observed
in latitude 55° 20ʹ S., longitude made from Cape
Deseada 3° 24ʹ E. In this situation we were about
three leagues from the nearest shore, which was that
of an island. This I named Gilbert Isle, after my
master. It is nearly of the same height with the rest
of the coast, and shows a surface composed of several
peaked rocks unequally high. A little to the S.&nbsp;E.
of it are some smaller islands, and, without them,
breakers.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have before observed that this is the most desolate
coast I ever saw. It seems entirely composed of
rocky mountains without the least appearance of
vegetation. These mountains terminate in horrible
precipices, whose craggy summits spire up to a vast
height; so that hardly any thing in nature can appear
with a more barren and savage aspect than the
whole of this country. The inland mountains were
covered with snow, but those on the sea-coast were
not. We judged the former to belong to the main of
Terra del Fuego, and the latter to be islands, so
ranged as apparently to form a coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>After three hours’ calm, we got a breeze at S.&nbsp;E. by
E. and having made a short trip to south, stood in
for the land; the most advanced point of which, that
we had in sight, bore E., distant ten leagues. This
is a lofty promontory, lying E.&nbsp;S. E. nineteen leagues
from Gilbert Isle, and situated in latitude 55° 26ʹ S.
longitude 70° 25ʹ W. Viewed from the situation we
now were in, it terminated in two high towers; and
within them a hill shaped like a sugar-loaf. This
wild rock therefore obtained the name of York
Minster. Two leagues to the westward of this head
appeared a large inlet, the west point of which we
fetched in with, by nine o’clock, when we tacked in
forty-one fathoms water, half a league from the
shore: to the westward of this inlet was another, with
several islands lying in the entrance.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the night between the 19th and 20th, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>had little wind easterly, which in the morning veered
to N.&nbsp;E. and N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E., but it was too faint to be of use;
and at ten, we had a calm, when we observed the
ship to drive from off the shore out to sea. We had
made the same observation the day before. This
must have been occasioned by a current; and the
melting of the snow increasing, the inland waters will
cause a stream to run out of most of these inlets. At
noon, we observed in latitude 55° 39ʹ 30ʺ S. York
Minster, then bearing N. 15° E., distant five leagues;
and Round-hill, just peeping above the horizon,
which we judged to belong to the isles of Saint
Ildefonso, E. 25° S., ten or eleven leagues distant.
At ten o’clock, a breeze springing up at E. by S., I
took this opportunity to stand in for the land, being
desirous of going into one of the many ports which
seemed open to receive us, in order to take a view of
the country, and to recruit our stock of wood and
water.</p>

<p class='c000'>In standing in for an opening, which appeared on
the east side of York Minster, we had forty, thirty-seven,
fifty, and sixty fathoms water, a bottom of
small stones and shells. When we had the last soundings
we were nearly in the middle between the two
points that form the entrance to the inlet, which we
observed to branch into two arms, both of them lying
in nearly N., and disjoined by a high rocky point.
We stood for the eastern branch as being clear of
islets; and after passing a black rocky one, lying
without the point just mentioned, we sounded and
found no bottom with a line of an hundred and
seventy fathoms. This was altogether unexpected,
and a circumstance that would not have been regarded,
if the breeze had continued; but, at this time,
it fell calm, so that it was not possible to extricate
ourselves from this disagreeable situation. Two
boats were hoisted out, and sent a-head to tow; but
they would have availed little, had not a breeze
sprung up about eight o’clock, at S.&nbsp;W. which put it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>in my power either to stand out to sea, or up the
inlet. Prudence seemed to point out the former;
but the desire of finding a good port, and of learning
something of the country, getting the better of every
other consideration, I resolved to stand in; and as
night was approaching, our safety depended on getting
to an anchor. With this view we continued to
sound, but always had an unfathomable depth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hauling up under the east side of the land which
divided the two arms, and seeing a small cove a-head,
I sent a boat to sound; and we kept as near the
shore as the flurries from the land would permit, in
order to be able to get into this place, if there should
be anchorage. The boat soon returned, and informed
us that there was thirty and twenty-five fathoms water,
a full cable’s length from the shore. Here we anchored
in thirty fathoms, the bottom sand and broken shells;
and carried out a kedge and hawser, to steady the
ship for the night.</p>

  <h2 id='b4c2' class='c004'>CHAP. II.<br /> <br />TRANSACTIONS IN CHRISTMAS SOUND, WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE COUNTRY AND ITS INHABITANTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>The morning of the 21st was calm and pleasant.
After breakfast, I set out with two boats to look for
a more secure station. We no sooner got round, or
above the point, under which the ship lay, than we
found a cove in which was anchorage in thirty, twenty,
and fifteen fathoms, the bottom stones and sand.
At the head of the cove was a stony beach, a valley
covered with wood, and a stream of fresh water;
so that there was every thing we could expect to find
in such a place, or rather more; for we shot three
geese out of four that we saw, and caught some
young ones, which we afterwards let go.</p>

<p class='c000'>After discovering and sounding this cove, I sent
lieutenant Clerke, who commanded the other boat,
on board, with orders to remove the ship into this
place, while I proceeded farther up the inlet. I presently
saw that the land we were under, which disjoined
the two arms, as mentioned before, was an
island, at the north end of which the two channels
united. After this I hastened on board, and found
every thing in readiness to weigh; which was accordingly
done, and all the boats sent a-head to tow
the ship round the point. But, at that moment, a
light breeze came in from the sea too scant to fill our
sails; so that we were obliged to drop the anchor
again, for fear of falling upon the point, and to
carry out a kedge to windward. That being done,
we hove up the anchor, warped up to, and weighed
the kedge, and proceeding round the point under our
stay-sails, there anchored with the best bower, in
twenty fathoms; and moored with the other bower,
which lay to the north, in thirteen fathoms. In this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>position we were shut in from the sea by the point
above mentioned, which was in one with the extremity
of the inlet to the east. Some islets, off the
next point above us, covered us from the N.&nbsp;W., from
which quarter the wind had the greatest fetch; and
our distance from the shore was about one-third of a
mile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus situated, we went to work, to clear a place
to fill water, to cut wood, and to set up a tent for the
reception of a guard, which was thought necessary;
as we had already discovered, that, barren as this
country is, it was not without people, though we had
not yet seen any. Mr. Wales also got his observatory
and instruments on shore; but it was with the greatest
difficulty he could find a place of sufficient stability,
and clear of the mountains, which every where surrounded
us, to set them up in; and at last he was
obliged to content himself with the top of a rock,
not more than nine feet over.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next day I sent lieutenants Clerke and Pickersgill,
accompanied by some of the other officers, to
examine and draw a sketch of the channel on the
other side of the island; and I went myself in another
boat, accompanied by the botanists, to survey
the northern parts of the sound. In my way, I
landed on the point of a low isle covered with herbage,
part of which had been lately burnt; we likewise
saw a hut; signs sufficient that people were in
the neighbourhood. After I had taken the necessary
bearings, we proceeded round the east end of Burnt
Island, and over to what we judged to be the main
of Terra del Fuego, where we found a very fine harbour
encompassed by steep rocks of vast height,
down which ran many limpid streams of water; and
at the foot of the rocks, some tufts of trees, fit for
little else but fuel.</p>

<p class='c000'>This harbour, which I shall distinguish by the name
of the Devil’s Bason, is divided, as it were, into two,
an inner and an outer one; and the communication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>between them is by a narrow channel five fathoms
deep. In the outer bason, I found thirteen and seventeen
fathoms water, and in the inner, seventeen
and twenty-three. This last is as secure a place as
can be, but nothing can be more gloomy. The vast
height of the savage rocks which encompass it, deprived
great part of it, even on this day, of the meridian
sun. The outer harbour is not quite free from
this inconvenience, but far more so than the other;
it is also rather more commodious, and equally safe.
It lies in the direction of north, a mile and an half
distant from the east end of Burnt Island. I likewise
found a good anchoring-place a little to the west
of this harbour, before a stream of water that comes
out of a lake or large reservoir, which is continually
supplied by a cascade falling into it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving this place, we proceeded along the shore
to the westward, and found other harbours, which I
had not time to look into. In all of them is fresh
water, and wood for fuel; but except these little tufts
of bushes, the whole country is a barren rock, doomed
by nature to everlasting sterility. The low islands,
and even some of the higher, which lie scattered up
and down the sound, are indeed mostly covered with
shrubs and herbage, the soil a black rotten turf, evidently
composed, by length of time, of decayed vegetables.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had an opportunity to verify what we had observed
at sea; that the sea-coast is composed of a
number of large and small islands, and that the numerous
inlets are formed by the junction of several
channels; at least so it is here. On one of these
low islands, we found several huts, which had lately
been inhabited; and near them was a good deal of
celery, with which we loaded our boat, and returned
on board at seven o’clock in the evening. In this
expedition we met with little game; one duck, three
or four shags, and about that number of rails or sea-pies,
being all we got. The other boat returned on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>board some hours before; having found two harbours
on the west side of the other channel; the one large,
and the other small; but both of them safe and commodious;
though, by the sketch Mr. Pickersgill had
taken of them, the access to both appeared rather
intricate.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was now told of a melancholy accident which
had befallen one of our marines. He had not been
seen since eleven or twelve o’clock the preceding night.
It was supposed that he had fallen over-board out of
the head, where he had been last seen, and was
drowned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having fine pleasant weather on the 23d, I sent
lieutenant Pickersgill in the cutter, to explore the
east side of the sound, and went myself in the
pinnace to the west side, with an intent to go round
the island, under which we were at anchor, (and
which I shall distinguish by the name of Shag island),
in order to view the passage leading to the harbours
Mr. Pickersgill had discovered the day before, on
which I made the following observations. In coming
from sea, leave all the rocks and islands, lying off
and within York Minster, on your larboard side;
and the black rock, which lies off the south end of
Shag island, on your starboard; and when abreast
of the south end of that island, haul over for the
west shore, taking care to avoid the beds of weeds
you will see before you, as they always grow on rocks;
some of which I have found twelve fathoms under
water; but it is always best to keep clear of them.
The entrance to the large harbour, or Port Clerke,
is just to the north of some low rocks lying off a
point on Shag Island. This harbour lies in W. by S.
a mile and an half, and hath in it from twelve to
twenty-four fathoms depth, wood and fresh water.
About a mile without, or to the southward of Port
Clerke, is, or seemed to be, another which I did not
examine. It is formed by a large island, which covers
it from the south and east winds. Without this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>island, that is, between it and York Minster, the
sea seemed strewed with islets, rocks, and breakers.
In proceeding round the south end of Shag Island,
we observed the shags to breed in vast numbers in
the cliffs of the rocks. Some of the old ones we
shot, but could not come at the young ones, which
are, by far, the best eating. On the east side of the
island we saw some geese; and having with difficulty
landed, we killed three, which at this time was a
valuable acquisition.</p>

<p class='c000'>About seven in the evening we got on board,
where Mr. Pickersgill had arrived but just before.
He informed me that the land opposite to our station
was an island, which he had been round; that, on
another, more to the north, he found many <em>terns’</em>
eggs, and that without the great island, between it
and the east head, lay a cove in which were many
geese; one only of which he got, besides some young
goslins.</p>

<p class='c000'>This information of Mr. Pickersgill induced me
to make up two shooting parties next day; Mr. Pickersgill
and his associates going in the cutter, and
myself and the botanists in the pinnace. Mr. Pickersgill
went by the N.&nbsp;E. side of the large island
above mentioned, which obtained the name of Goose
Island; and I went by the S.&nbsp;W. side. As soon as
we got under the island, we found plenty of shags
in the cliffs, but, without staying to spend our time
and shot upon these, we proceeded on, and presently
found sport enough; for, in the south of the island,
were abundance of geese. It happened to be the
moulting season; and most of them were on shore
for that purpose, and could not fly. There being a
great surf, we found great difficulty in landing, and
very bad climbing over the rocks when we were landed;
so that hundreds of the geese escaped us, some into
the sea, and others up into the island. We, however,
by one means or other, got sixty-two; with which
we returned on board, all heartily tired; but the acquisition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>we had made overbalanced every other consideration,
and we sat down with a good appetite to supper,
on part of what the preceding day had produced.
Mr. Pickersgill and his associates had got on board
some time before us with fourteen geese; so that I
was able to make distribution to the whole crew,
which was the more acceptable, on account of the
approaching festival; for, had not Providence thus
singularly provided for us, our Christmas cheer must
have been salt beef and pork.</p>

<p class='c000'>I now learnt that a number of the natives, in nine
canoes, had been along-side the ship; and some on
board. Little address was required to persuade them
to either; for they seemed to be well enough acquainted
with Europeans, and had, amongst them,
some of their knives.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning, the 25th, they made us another
visit. I found them to be of the same nation I
had formerly seen in Success-Bay; and the same
which M. de Bougainville distinguishes by the name
of Pecheras; a word which these had, on every occasion,
in their mouths. They are a little, ugly, half-starved,
beardless race. I saw not a tall person
amongst them. They were almost naked; their
clothing was a seal-skin; some had two or three sewed
together, so as to make a cloak which reached to the
knees; but the most of them had only one skin, hardly
large enough to cover their shoulders; and all their
lower parts were quite naked. The women, I was
told, cover their nakedness with a flap of a seal-skin,
but in other respects are clothed like the men. They,
as well as the children, remained in the canoes. I
saw two young children at the breast entirely naked;
thus they are inured from their infancy to cold and
hardships. They had with them bows and arrows,
and darts, or rather harpoons, made of bone, and
fitted to a staff. I suppose they were intended to kill
seals and fish; they may also kill whales with them,
as the Esquimaux do. I know not if they resemble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>them in their love of train-oil; but they, and every
thing they had, smelt most intolerably of it. I ordered
them some biscuit, but did not observe them
so fond of it as I had been told. They were much
better pleased when I gave them some medals, knives,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>The women and children, as before observed, remained
in the canoes. These were made of bark;
and in each was a fire, over which the poor creatures
huddled themselves. I cannot suppose that they carry
a fire in their canoes for this purpose only; but
rather that it may be always ready to remove ashore
wherever they land; for let their method of obtaining
fire be what it may, they cannot be always sure
of finding dry fuel that will kindle from a spark.
They likewise carry in their canoes large seal hides,
which, I judged, were to shelter them when at sea,
and to serve as covering to their huts on shore; and
occasionally to be used for sails.</p>

<p class='c000'>They all retired before dinner, and did not wait to
partake of our Christmas cheer. Indeed I believe
no one invited them, and for good reasons; for their
dirty persons, and the stench they carried about them,
were enough to spoil the appetite of any European;
and that would have been a real disappointment, as
we had not experienced such fare for some time.
Roast and boiled geese, goose-pye, &amp;c. was a treat
little known to us; and we had yet some Madeira
wine left, which was the only article of our provision
that was mended by keeping. So that our friends in
England, did not, perhaps, celebrate Christmas more
cheerfully than we did.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 26th, little wind, next to a calm, and fair
weather, except in the morning, when we had some
showers of rain. In the evening, when it was cold,
the natives made us another visit; and it being distressing
to see them stand trembling and naked on
the deck, I could do no less than to give them some
baize and old canvass to cover themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Having already completed our water, on the 27th
I ordered the wood, tent, and observatory to be got
on board; and, as this was work for the day, a party
of us went in two boats to shoot geese, the weather
being fine and pleasant. We proceeded round by the
south side of Goose Island, and picked up in all thirty-one.
On the east side of the island, to the north of the
east point, is good anchorage, in seventeen fathoms water,
where it is entirely land-locked. This is a good
place for ships to lie in that are bound to the west.
On the north side of this isle, I observed three fine
coves, in which were both wood and water; but it
being near night, I had no time to sound them; though
I doubt not, there is anchorage. The way to come at
them is by the west end of the island.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I returned on board, I found every thing got
off the shore, and the launch in; so that we now
only waited for a wind to put to sea. The festival,
which we celebrated at this place, occasioned my
giving it the name of Christmas Sound. The entrance,
which is three leagues wide, is situated in
the latitude of 55° 27ʹ S., longitude 70° 16ʹ W.; and
in the direction of N. 37° W. from St. Ildefonso Isles,
distant ten leagues. These isles are the best landmark
for finding the sound. York Minster, which
is the only remarkable land about it, will hardly
be known by a stranger from any description
that can be given of it, because it alters its appearance
according to the different situations it is viewed
from. Besides the black rock, which lies off the end
of Shag Island, there is another about midway between
this and the east shore. A copious description
of this sound is unnecessary, as few would be benefited
by it. The sketch which accompanies this journal
will be a sufficient guide for such ships as chance
may bring hither. Anchorage, tufts of wood, and
fresh water, will be found in all the coves and harbours.
I would advise no one to anchor very near
the shore for the sake of having a moderate depth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>of water; because there I generally found a rocky
bottom.</p>

<p class='c000'>The refreshments to be got here are precarious, as
they consist chiefly of wild fowl, and may probably
never be found in such plenty as to supply the crew
of a ship; and fish, so far as we can judge, are scarce.
Indeed the plenty of wild fowl made us pay less attention
to fishing. Here are, however, plenty of muscles,
not very large, but well tasted; and very good
celery is to be met with on several of the low islets,
and where the natives have their habitations. The
wild-fowl are geese, ducks, sea-pies, shags, and that
kind of gull so often mentioned in this journal under
the name of Port Egmont hen. Here is a kind of
duck, called by our people race-horses, on account of
the great swiftness with which they run on the water;
for they cannot fly, the wings being too short to support
the body in the air. This bird is at the Falkland
Islands, as appears by Pernety’s journal.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c009'><sup>[15]</sup></a> The
geese too are there, and seem to be very well described
under the name of bustards. They are much
smaller than our English tame geese, but eat as well
as any I ever tasted. They have short black bills
and yellow feet. The gander is all white; the female
is spotted black and white, or grey with a large
white spot on each wing. Besides the bird above
mentioned, here are several other aquatic, and some
land ones; but of the latter not many.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the <a id='know'></a>knowledge which the inhabitants seem
to have of Europeans, we may suppose that they do
not live here continually, but retire to the north
during the winter. I have often wondered that these
people do not clothe themselves better, since nature
has certainly provided materials. They might line
their seal-skin cloaks with the skins and feathers of
aquatic birds; they might make their cloaks larger,
and employ the same skins for other parts of clothing;
for I cannot suppose they are scarce with them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>They were ready enough to part with those they had
to our people; which they hardly would have done,
had they not known where to have got more.
In short, of all the nations I have seen, the Pecheras
are the most wretched. They are doomed to live in
one of the most inhospitable climates in the world,
without having sagacity enough to provide themselves
with such conveniences as may render life in some
measure more comfortable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barren as this country is, it abounds with a variety
of unknown plants, and gave sufficient employment
to Mr. Forster and his party. The tree which produceth
the Winter’s bark, is found here in the woods,
as is the holly-leaved barberry, and some other
sorts which I know not, but I believe are common
in the Straits of Magalhaens. We found plenty of
a berry which we called the cranberry, because they
are nearly of the same colour, size, and shape. It
grows on a bushy plant, has a bitterish taste, rather
insipid; but may be eaten either raw or in tarts, and
is used as food by the natives.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>At four o’clock in the morning on the 28th, we
began to unmoor; and at eight weighed and stood
out to sea, with a light breeze at N.&nbsp;W. which afterwards
freshened, and was attended with rain. At
noon, the east point of the sound (Point Nativity),
bore N.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W.; distant one and a half leagues, and St.
Ildefonso Isles S.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
S., distant seven leagues. The
coast seemed to trend in the direction of E. by S.,
but the weather being very hazy, nothing appeared
distinct.</p>

<p class='c000'>We continued to steer S.&nbsp;E. by E. and E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.,
with a fresh breeze at W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W., till four o’clock
P.&nbsp;M., when we hauled to the South, in order to have
a nearer view of St. Ildefonso Isles. At this time we
were abreast of an inlet, which lies E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. about
seven leagues from the sound; but it must be observed
that there are some isles without this distinction.
At the west point of the inlet, are two high peaked
hills; and below them, to the E. two round hills, or
isles, which lie in the direction of N.&nbsp;E. and S.&nbsp;W.
of each other. An island, or what appeared to be an
island, lay in the entrance; and another but smaller
inlet appeared to the west of this; indeed, the coast
appeared indented and broken as usual.</p>

<p class='c000'>At half-past five o’clock, the weather clearing up,
gave us a good sight of Ildefonso Isles. They are
a group of islands and rocks above water, situated
above six leagues from the main, and in the latitude
of 55° 53ʹ S., longitude 69° 41ʹ W.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>We now resumed our course to the east; and, at
sun-set, the most advanced land bore S.&nbsp;E. by E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span>
E.;
and a point, which I judged to be the west point of
Nassau Bay, discovered by the Dutch fleet under the
command of Admiral Hermite in 1624, bore N. 80°
E., six leagues distant. In some charts, this point
is called false Cape Horn, as being the southern
point of Terra del Fuego. It is situated in latitude
55° 39ʹ S. From the inlet above-mentioned to this
false cape, the direction of the coast is nearly E.,
half a point S., distant fourteen or fifteen leagues.</p>

<p class='c000'>At ten o’clock, having shortened sail, we spent
the night in making short boards under the top-sails,
and at three next morning, made sail, and steered
S.&nbsp;E. by S. with a fresh breeze at W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W., the weather
somewhat hazy. At this time, the west entrance
to Nassau Bay extended from N. by E. to
N.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E., and the south side of Hermite’s Isles, E. by
S. At four, <i>Cape Horn</i>, for which we now steered,
bore E. by S. It is known, at a distance, by a high
round hill over it. A point to the W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. shows a
surface not unlike this; but their situations alone
will always distinguish the one from the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>At half past seven, we passed this famous <em>cape</em>,
and entered the Southern Atlantic Ocean. It is the
very same point of land I took for the cape, when
I passed it in 1769, which at that time I was doubtful
of. It is the most southern extremity on a group
of islands of unequal extent, lying before Nassau
Bay, known by the name of Hermite Islands, and is
situated in the latitude of 55° 58ʹ, and in the longitude
of 68° 13ʹ west, according to the observations
made of it in 1769. But the observations, which we
had in Christmas Sound, and reduced to the cape, by
the watch, and others, which we had afterwards, and
reduced back to it by the same means, place it in
67° 19ʹ. It is most probable that a mean between
the two, viz. 67° 46ʹ will be nearest the truth. On
the N.&nbsp;W. side of the cape are two peaked rocks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>like sugar loaves. They lie N.&nbsp;W. by N. and S.&nbsp;E.
by S., by compass, of each other. Some other straggling
low rocks lie west of the cape, and one south
of it; but they are all near the shore. From Christmas
Sound to Cape Horn, the course is E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span>
E.
distant thirty-one leagues. In the direction of E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E.,
three leagues from Cape Horn, is a rocky point, which
I called Mistaken Cape, and is the southern point of
the easternmost of Hermite Isles. Between these
two capes there seemed to be a passage directly into
Nassau Bay; some small isles were seen in the passage;
and the coast, on the west side, had the appearance
of forming good bays or harbours. In
some charts, Cape Horn is laid down as belonging to
a small island. This was neither confirmed, nor can
it be contradicted by us; for several breakers appeared
in the coast, both to the east and west of it;
and the hazy weather rendered every object indistinct.
The summits of some of the hills were rocky,
but the sides and valleys seemed covered with a green
turf, and wooded in tufts.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Cape Horn we steered E. by N.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
N. which
direction carried us without the rocks that lie off
Mistaken Cape. These rocks are white with the
dung of fowls; and vast numbers were seen about
them. After passing them, we steered N.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E.
and N.&nbsp;E. for Strait Le Maire, with a view of
looking into Success Bay, to see if there were any
traces of the Adventure having been there. At
eight o’clock in the evening, drawing near the strait,
we shortened sail, and hauled the wind. At this
time the Sugar-loaf on Terra del Fuego bore N. 33°
W.; the point of Success Bay, just open of the cape
of the same name, bearing N. 20° E.; and Staten
Land, extending from N. 53° E. to 67° E. Soon
after, the wind died away, and we had light airs and
calms by turns till near noon the next day; during
which time we were driven by the current over to
Staten Land.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>The calm being succeeded by a light breeze at N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W.
we stood over for Success Bay, assisted by the
currents, which set to the north. Before this, we
had hoisted our colours, and fired two guns; and
soon after, saw a smoke rise out of the woods, above
the south point of the bay; which I judged was made
by the natives, as it was at the place where they resided
when I was here in 1769. As soon as we got
off the bay, I sent lieutenant Pickersgill to see if any
traces remained of the Adventure having been there
lately; and in the mean time we stood on and off
with the ship. At two o’clock, the current turned
and set to the south; and Mr. Pickersgill informed
me when he returned, that it was falling water on
shore; which was contrary to what I had observed
when I was here before; for I thought then that the
flood came from the north. Mr. Pickersgill saw not
the least signs of any ship having been there lately. I
had inscribed our ship’s name on a card, which he
nailed to a tree at the place where the Endeavour
watered. This was done with a view of giving
Captain Furneaux some information, in case he should
be behind us and put in here.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Mr. Pickersgill’s landing, he was courteously
received by several of the natives, who were cloathed
in guanicoe and seal skins, and had on their arms
bracelets, made of silver wire, and wrought not unlike
the hilt of a sword, being no doubt the manufacture
of some Europeans. They were the same kind
of people we had seen in Christmas Sound; and,
like them, repeated the word Pechera on every occasion.
One man spoke much to Mr. Pickersgill,
pointing first to the ship and then to the bay, as
if he wanted her to come in. Mr. Pickersgill said
the bay was full of whales and seals; and we had
observed the same in the strait, especially on the
Terra del Fuego side, where the whales, in particular,
are exceedingly numerous.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the boat was hoisted in, which was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>till near six o’clock, we made sail to the east, with a
fine breeze at north. For since we had explored
the south coast of Terra del Fuego, I resolved to do
the same by Staten Land; which I believed to have
been as little known as the former. At nine o’clock
the wind freshening, and veering to N.&nbsp;W. we tacked,
and stood to S.&nbsp;W. in order to spend the night; which
proved none of the best, being stormy and hazy, with
rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning, at three o’clock, we bore up for the
east end of Staten Land, which, at half past four,
bore S. 60° E. the west end S. 2° E. and the land of
Terra del Fuego S. 40° W. Soon after I had taken
these bearings, the land was again obscured in a thick
haze, and we were obliged to make way, as it were, in
the dark; for it was but now and then we got a
sight of the coast. As we advanced to the east, we
perceived several islands, of unequal extent, lying
off the land. There seemed to be a clear passage between
the easternmost and the one next to it, to the
west. I would gladly have gone through this passage,
and anchored under one of the islands, to have waited
for better weather; for on sounding we found only
twenty-nine fathoms water; but when I considered
that this was running to leeward in the dark, I chose
to keep without the islands, and accordingly hauled
off to the north. At eight o’clock we were abreast of
the most eastern isle, distant from it about two miles,
and had the same depth of water as before. I now
shortened sail to the three top-sails, to wait for clear
weather; for the fog was so thick, that we could see
no other land than this island. After waiting an
hour, and the weather not clearing up, we bore, and
hauled round the east end of the island, for the sake
of smooth water and anchorage, if it should be necessary.
In hauling round, we found a strong race
of a current, like unto broken water; but we had no
less than nineteen fathoms. We also saw on the
island abundance of seals and birds. This was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>temptation too great for people in our situation to
withstand, to whom fresh provisions of any kind were
acceptable; and determined me to anchor, in order
that we might taste of what we now only saw at a
distance. At length, after making a few boards,
fishing, as it were, for the best ground, we anchored
in twenty-one fathoms water, a stony bottom, about
a mile from the island, which extended from N. 18°
E. to N. 55°
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W.; and soon after, the weather clearing
up, we saw Cape St. John, or the east end of Staten
Land, bearing S. 75° E., distant four leagues.
We were sheltered from the south wind by Staten
Land, and from the north wind by the island; the
other isles lay to the west, and secured us from that
wind; but beside being open to the N.&nbsp;E. and E. we
also lay exposed to the N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. winds. This might
have been avoided by anchoring more to the west;
but I made choice of my situation for two reasons:
first, to be near the island we intended to land upon;
and secondly, to be able to get to sea with any wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>After dinner we hoisted out three boats, and landed
with a large party of men; some to kill seals; others
to catch or kill birds, fish, or what came in our way.
To find of the former, it mattered not where we
landed; for the whole shore was covered with them;
and, by the noise they made, one would have thought
the island was stocked with cows and calves. On
landing, we found they were a different animal from
seals, but in shape and motion exactly resembling
them. We called them lions, on account of the great
resemblance the male has to that beast. Here were
also the same kind of seals which we found in New
Zealand, generally known by the name of sea-bears;
at least, we gave them that name. They were, in
general, so tame, or rather stupid, as to suffer us to
come near enough to knock them down with sticks;
but the large ones we shot, not thinking it safe to
approach them. We also found on the island abundance
of penguins and shags; and the latter had young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>ones almost fledged, and just to our taste. Here
were geese and ducks, but not many; birds of prey,
and a few small birds. In the evening we returned on
board, our boats well laden with one thing or other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next day being January the 1st, 1775, finding that
nothing was wanting but a good harbour to make
this a tolerable place for ships to refresh at, whom
chance or design might bring hither, I sent Mr.
Gilbert over to Staten Land in the cutter, to look
for one. Appearances promised success, in a place
opposite the ship. I sent also two other boats for the
lions, &amp;c. we had killed the preceding day; and soon
after, I went myself, and observed the sun’s meridian
altitude at the N.&nbsp;E. end of the island, which gave
the latitude 54° 40ʹ 5ʺ south. After shooting a few
geese, some other birds, and plentifully supplying
ourselves with young shags, we returned on board,
laden with sea-lions, sea-bears, &amp;c. The old lions
and bears were killed chiefly for the sake of their
blubber, or fat, to make oil of; for, except their harslets,
which were tolerable, the flesh was too rank to be
eaten with any degree of relish. But the young cubs
were very palatable; and even the flesh of some of
the old lionesses was not much amiss; but that of
the old males was abominable. In the afternoon, I
sent some people on shore to skin and cut off the fat
of those which yet remained dead on shore; for we
had already more carcasses on board than necessary;
and I went myself, in another boat, to collect birds.
About ten o’clock Mr. Gilbert returned from Staten
Land, where he found a good port, situated three
leagues to the westward of Cape St. John, and in the
direction of north, a little easterly, from the N.&nbsp;E. end
of the eastern island. It may be known by some
small islands lying in the entrance. The channel,
which is on the east side of these islands, is half a
mile broad. The course in is S.&nbsp;W. by S. turning
gradually to W. by S. and west. The harbour lies
nearly in this last direction; is almost two miles in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>length; in some places near a mile broad; and hath
in it from fifty to ten fathoms water, a bottom of mud
and sand. Its shores are covered with wood fit for
fuel; and in it are several streams of fresh water. On
the islands were sea-lions, &amp;c. and such an innumerable
quantity of gulls as to darken the air when disturbed,
and almost to suffocate our people with their
dung. This they seemed to void in a way of defence,
and it stunk worse than asafœtida, or as it is
commonly called, devil’s dung. Our people also saw
several geese, ducks, and race-horses, which is also a
kind of duck. The day on which this port was discovered,
occasioned my calling it New Year’s Harbour.
It would be more convenient for ships bound
to the west, or round Cape Horn, if its situation
would permit them, to put to sea with an easterly
and northerly wind. This inconvenience, however, is
of little consequence, since these winds are never
known to be of long duration. The southerly and
westerly are the prevailing winds; so that a ship can
never be detained long in this port.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we could not sail in the morning of the 2d, for
want of wind, I sent a party of men on shore to the
island, on the same duty as before. Towards noon
we got a fresh breeze at west; but it came too late,
and I resolved to wait till the next morning, when,
at four o’clock, we weighed with a fresh gale at N.&nbsp;W.
by W. and stood for Cape St. John, which, at half-past
six, bore N. by E. distant four or five miles. This
cape, being the eastern point of Staten Land, a description
of it is unnecessary. It may, however, not
be amiss to say, that it is a rock of considerable
height, situated in the latitude of 54° 46ʹ South, longitude
64° 7ʹ West, with a rocky islet lying close
under the north part of it. To the westward of the
cape, about five or six miles, is an inlet, which seemed
to divide the land; that is, to communicate with the
sea to the south; and between this inlet and the cape
is a bay; but I cannot say of what depth. In sailing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>round the cape, we met with a very strong current
from the south: it made a race which looked like
breakers; and it was as much as we could do, with
a strong gale, to make head against it.</p>

<p class='c000'>After getting round the cape, I hauled up along
the south coast; and as soon as we had brought the
wind to blow off the land, it came upon us in such
heavy squalls as obliged us to double-reef our topsails.
It afterwards fell, by little and little, and at
noon ended in a calm. At this time Cape St. John
bore N. 20° east, distant three and a half leagues;
Cape St. Bartholomew, or the S.&nbsp;W. point of Staten
Land, S. 83° west; two high detached rocks N. 80°
west; and the place where the land seemed to be divided,
which had the same appearance on this side,
bore N. 15° west, three leagues distant. Latitude
observed 54° 56ʹ. In this situation we sounded, but
had no bottom, with a line of one hundred and twenty
fathoms. The calm was of very short duration, a
breeze presently springing up at N.&nbsp;W., but it was
too faint to make head against the current, and we
drove with it back to the N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. At four o’clock
the wind veered at once to S. by E. and blew in
squalls attended with rain. Two hours after, the
squalls and rain subsided, and the wind returning
back to the west, blew a gentle gale. All this time
the current set us to the north; so that, at eight
o’clock, Cape St. John bore W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. distant about
seven leagues. I now gave over plying, and steered
S.&nbsp;E. with a resolution to leave the land; judging it
to be sufficiently explored to answer the most general
purposes of navigation and geography.</p>

  <h2 id='b4c4' class='c004'>CHAP. IV.<br /> <br />OBSERVATIONS, GEOGRAPHICAL AND NAUTICAL, WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE ISLANDS NEAR STATEN LAND, AND THE ANIMALS FOUND IN THEM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>The annexed chart will very accurately shew the
direction, extent, and position of the coast, along
which I have sailed, either in this or my former voyage;
and no more is to be expected from it. The
latitudes have been determined by the sun’s meridian
altitude, which we were so fortunate as to obtain
every day, except the one we sailed from Christmas
Sound; which was of no consequence, as its latitude
was known before. The longitudes have been settled
by lunar observations, as is already mentioned. I
have taken 67° 46ʹ for the longitude of Cape Horn.
From this meridian, the longitudes of all the other
parts are deduced by the watch; by which the extent
of the whole must be determined to a few miles;
and whatever errors there may be in longitude, must
be general. But I think it highly probable, that the
longitude is determined to within a quarter of a degree.
Thus the extent of Terra del Fuego from east
to west, and consequently that of the Straits of Magalhaens,
will be found less than most navigators
have made it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to illustrate this, and to show the situations
of the neighbouring lands, and, by this means,
make the annexed chart of more general use, I have
extended it down to 47° of latitude. But I am only
answerable for the inaccuracy of such parts as I have
explored myself. In laying down the rest, I had recourse
to the following authorities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The longitude of Cape Virgin Mary, which is the
most essential point, as it determines the length of
the Straits of Magalhaens, is deduced from Lord
Anson, who made 2° 3ʹ difference of longitude between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>it and the Strait Le Maire. Now as the latter
lies in 65° 22ʹ, Cape Virgin Mary must lie in 67° 52ʹ,
which is the longitude I have assigned to it, and
which, I have reason to think, cannot be far from
the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Strait of Magalhaens, and the east coast of
Patagonia, are laid down from the observations made
by the late English and French navigators.</p>

<p class='c000'>The position of the west coast of America, from
Cape Victory northward, I have taken from the discoveries
of <i>Sarmiento</i>, a Spanish navigator, communicated
to me by Mr. Stuart, F. R. S.</p>

<p class='c000'>Falkland islands are copied from a sketch taken
from Captain M’Bride, who circumnavigated them
some years ago in his Majesty’s ship Jason; and their
distance from the main is agreeable to the run of the
Dolphin, under the command of Commodore Byron,
from Cape Virgin Mary to Port Egmont, and from
Port Egmont to Port Desire; both of which runs
were made in a few days; consequently no material
errors could happen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The S.&nbsp;W. coast of Terra del Fuego, with respect
to inlets, islands, &amp;c. may be compared to the coast
of Norway; for I doubt, if there be an extent of
three leagues where there is not an inlet or harbour
which will receive and shelter the largest shipping.
The worst is, that till these inlets are better known,
one has, as it were, to fish for anchorage. There
are several lurking rocks on the coast; but happily
none of them lie far from land, the approach to which
may be known by sounding, supposing the weather
so obscure that you cannot see it. For to judge of
the whole by the parts we have sounded, it is more
than probable that there are soundings all along the
coast, and for several leagues out to sea. Upon the
whole, this is by no means the dangerous coast it
has been represented.</p>

<p class='c000'>Staten Land lies nearly E. by N. and W. by S. and
is ten leagues long in that direction; and no where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>above three or four leagues broad. The coast is
rocky, much indented, and seemed to form several
bays or inlets. It shews a surface of craggy hills
which spire up to a vast height, especially near
the west end. Except the craggy summits of the
hills, the greatest part was covered with trees and
shrubs, or some sort of herbage, and there was little
or no snow on it. The currents between Cape Deseada
and Cape Horn, set from west to east, that is,
in the same direction as the coast; but they are by
no means considerable. To the east of the cape
their strength is much increased, and their direction
is N.&nbsp;E. towards Staten Land. They are rapid in
Strait Le Maire and along the south coast of Staten
Land, and set like a torrent round Cape St. John;
where they take a N.&nbsp;W. direction, and continue to
run very strong both within and without New Year’s
isles. While we lay at anchor within this island, I
observed that the current was strongest during the
flood; and that, on the ebb, its strength was so much
impaired, that the ship would sometimes ride head to
wind when it was at west and W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. This is only
to be understood of the place where the ship lay at
anchor; for at the very time we had a strong current
setting to the westward, Mr. Gilbert found one of
equal strength near the coast of Staten Land, setting
to the eastward; though probably this was an eddy
current or tide.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the tides are regulated by the moon, it is high-water
by the shore at this place, on the days of the
new and full moon, about four o’clock. The perpendicular
rise and fall is very inconsiderable, not
exceeding four feet at most. In Christmas Sound it
is high water at half past two o’clock on the days of
the full and change, and Mr. Wales observed it to
rise and fall, on a perpendicular, three feet six inches;
but this was during the neap-tides, consequently
the spring-tides must rise higher. To give such an
account of the tides and currents on these coasts as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>navigators might depend on, would require a multitude
of observations, and in different places, the
making of which would be a work of time. I confess
myself unprovided with materials for such a task;
and believe that the less I say on this subject the
fewer mistakes I shall make. But I think I have been
able to observe, that in Strait Le Maire, the southerly
tide or current, be it flood or ebb, begins to act on
the days of new and full moon about four o’clock,
which remark may be of use to ships who pass the
strait.</p>

<p class='c000'>Were I bound round Cape Horn to the west, and
not in want of wood or water, or any thing that might
make it necessary to put into port, I would not come
near the land at all. For by keeping out at sea, you
avoid the currents, which, I am satisfied, lose their
force at ten or twelve leagues from land; and at a
greater distance there is none.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the time we were upon the coast, we had
more calms than storms, and the winds so variable
that I question if a passage might not have been made
from east to west in as short a time as from west to
east; nor did we experience any cold weather. The
mercury in the thermometer at noon was never below
46°; and while we lay in Christmas Sound, it was
generally above temperate. At this place, the variation
was 23° 30ʹ east; a few leagues to the S.&nbsp;W. of
Strait Le Maire, it was 24°; and at anchor, within
New Year’s isles, it was 24° 20ʹ east.</p>

<p class='c000'>These isles are, in general, so unlike Staten Land,
especially the one on which we landed, that it deserves
a particular description. It shews a surface
of equal height, and elevated about thirty or forty
feet above the sea, from which it is defended by a
rocky coast. The inner part of the isle is covered
with a sort of sword-grass, very green, and of a great
length. It grows on little hillocks, of two or three
feet in diameter, and as many or more in height, in
large tufts, which seemed to be composed of the roots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>of the plant matted together. Among these hillocks
are a vast number of paths made by sea-bears and
penguins, by which they retire into the centre of the
isle. It is, nevertheless, exceedingly bad travelling;
for these paths are so dirty that one is sometimes up
to the knees in mire. Besides this plant, there are a
few other grasses, a kind of heath, and some celery.
The whole surface is moist and wet, and on the coast
are several small streams of water. The sword-grass,
as I call it, seems to be the same that grows in Falkland
isles, described by Bougainville as a kind of
<i>gladiolus</i>, or rather a species of <i>gramen</i>,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c009'><sup>[16]</sup></a> and named
by Pernety, corn-flags.</p>

<p class='c000'>The animals found on this little spot are sea-lions,
sea-bears, a variety of oceanic and some land birds.
The sea-lion is pretty well described by Pernety;
though those we saw here have not such fore-feet or
fins as that he has given a plate of, but such fins as
that which he calls the sea-wolf. Nor did we see any
of the size he speaks of; the largest not being more
than twelve or fourteen feet in length, and perhaps
eight or ten in circumference. They are not of that
kind described, under the same name, by Lord Anson;
but, for aught I know, these would more properly
deserve that appellation; the long hair with
which the back of the head, the neck and shoulders,
are covered, giving them greatly the air and appearance
of a lion. The other part of the body is covered
with a short hair, little longer than that of a cow
or a horse, and the whole is a dark brown. The
female is not half so big as the male, and is covered
with a short hair of an ash, or light dun colour. They
live, as it were, in herds, on the rocks, and near the
sea-shore. As this was the time for engendering as
well as bringing forth their young, we have seen a
male with twenty or thirty females about him, and
always very attentive to keep them all to himself, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>beating off every other male who attempted to come
into his flock. Others again had a less number; some
no more than one or two; and here and there we
have seen one lying growling in a retired place, alone,
and suffering neither males nor females to approach
him: we judged these were old and superannuated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sea-bears are not so large, by far, as the lions,
but rather larger than a common seal. They have
none of that long hair which distinguishes the lion.
Theirs is all of an equal length, and finer than that
of the lion, something like an otter’s; and the general
colour is that of iron-grey. This is the kind
which the French call sea-wolfs, and the English
seals; they are, however, different from the seals
we have in Europe and in North America. The
lions may too, without any great impropriety, be
called overgrown seals; for they are all of the same
species. It was not at all dangerous to go among
them; for they either fled or lay still. The only
danger was in going between them and the sea; for
if they took fright at any thing, they would come
down in such numbers, that, if you could not get
out of their way, you would be run over. Sometimes,
when we came suddenly upon them, or waked
them out of their sleep (for they are a sluggish sleepy
animal), they would raise up their heads, snort and
snarl, and look as fierce as if they meant to devour
us; but as we advanced upon them, they always run
away; so that they are downright bullies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The penguin is an amphibious bird, so well known
to most people, that I shall only observe, they are
here in prodigious numbers; so that we could knock
down as many as we pleased with a stick. I cannot
say they are good eating. I have indeed made several
good meals of them; but it was for want of better
victuals. They either do not breed here, or else
this was not the season; for we saw neither eggs nor
young ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shags breed here in vast numbers; and we carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>on board not a few, as they are very good eating.
They take certain spots to themselves, and build their
nests near the edge of the cliffs on little hillocks,
which are either those of the sword-grass, or else
they are made by the shags building on them from
year to year. There is another sort rather smaller
than these, which breed on the cliffs of rocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The geese are of the same sort we found in Christmas
Sound; we saw but few; and some had young
ones. Mr. Forster shot one which was different from
these, being larger, with a grey plumage, and black
feet. The others make a noise exactly like a duck.
Here were ducks, but not many; and several of that
sort which we called race-horses. We shot some,
and found them to weigh twenty-nine or thirty
pounds; those who ate of them said they were very
good.</p>

<p class='c000'>The oceanic birds were gulls, terns, Port Egmont
hens, and a large brown bird of the size of an
albatross, which Pernety calls quebrantahuessas.
We called them Mother Cary’s geese, and found
them pretty good eating. The land-birds were eagles,
or hawks, bald-headed vultures, or what our seamen
called turkey buzzards, thrushes, and a few other
small birds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our naturalists found two new species of birds.
The one is about the size of a pigeon, the plumage
as white as milk. They feed along shore, probably
on shell-fish and carrion; for they have a very disagreeable
smell. When we first saw these birds, we
thought they were the snow-peterel, but the moment
they were in our possession, the mistake was discovered;
for they resemble them in nothing but size
and colour. These are not web-footed. The other
sort is a species of curlews nearly as big as a heron.
It has a variegated plumage, the principal colours
whereof are light grey, and a long crooked bill.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had almost forgot to mention that there are sea-pies,
or what we called, when in New Zealand, curlews;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>but we only saw a few straggling pairs. It
may not be amiss to observe, that the shags are the
same bird which Bougainville calls saw-bills; but he
is mistaken in saying that the quebrantahuessas are
their enemies; for this bird is of the peterel tribe,
feeds wholly on fish, and is to be found in all the
high southern latitudes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is amazing to see how the different animals,
which inhabit this little spot, are mutually reconciled.
They seem to have entered into a league not to disturb
each other’s tranquillity. The sea-lions occupy
most of the sea-coast; the sea-bears take up their
abode in the isle; the shags have post in the highest
cliffs; the penguins fix their quarters where there is
the most easy communication to and from the sea;
and the other birds chuse more retired places. We
have seen all these animals mix together, like domestic
cattle and poultry in a farm-yard, without one
attempting to molest the other. Nay, I have often
observed the eagles and vultures sitting on the hillocks
among the shags, without the latter, either
young or old, being disturbed at their presence. It
may be asked how these birds of prey live? I suppose,
on the carcasses of seals and birds which die
by various causes; and probably not few, as they are
so numerous.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>Having left the land in the evening of the 3d, as
before mentioned, we saw it again next morning, at
three o’clock, bearing W. Wind continued to blow
a steady fresh breeze till six P.&nbsp;M. when it shifted in
a heavy squall to S.&nbsp;W. which came so suddenly upon
us, that we had not time to take in the sails, and was
the occasion of carrying away a top-gallant mast, a
studding-sail boom, and a fore studding-sail. The
squall ended in a heavy shower of rain, but the wind
remained at S.&nbsp;W. Our course was S.&nbsp;E. with a view
of discovering that extensive coast, laid down by
Mr. Dalrymple in his chart, in which is the Gulph
of St. Sebastian. I designed to make the western
point of that gulph, in order to have all the other
parts before me. Indeed, I had some doubt of the
existence of such a coast; and this appeared to me
the best route for clearing it up, and for exploring
the southern part of this ocean.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 5th, fresh gales, and wet and cloudy
weather. At noon observed in 57° 9ʹ, longitude
made from Cape Saint John, 5° 2ʹ E. At six o’clock,
P.&nbsp;M. being in the latitude 57° 21ʹ, and in longitude
57° 45ʹ W., the variation was 21° 28ʹ E.</p>

<p class='c000'>At eight o’clock in the evening of the 6th, being
then in the latitude of 58° 9ʹ S. longitude 53° 14ʹ W.,
we close-reefed our top-sails, and hauled to the north,
with a very strong gale at W., attended with a thick
haze and sleet. The situation just mentioned is
nearly the same that Mr. Dalrymple assigns for the
S.&nbsp;W. point of the Gulph of St. Sebastian. But as
we saw neither land, nor signs of land, I was the
more doubtful of its existence, and was fearful, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>by keeping to the south I might miss the land said to
be discovered by La Roche in 1675, and by the ship
Lion in 1756, which Mr. Dalrymple places in 54° 30ʹ
latitude, and 45° of longitude; but on looking over
Danville’s Chart, I found it laid down 9° or 10° more
to the west; this difference of situation being to me
a sign of the uncertainty of both accounts, determined
me to get into the parallel as soon as possible, and
was the reason of my hauling to the north at this
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards the morning of the 7th, the gale abated,
the weather cleared up, and the wind veered to the
W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. where it continued till midnight; after which
it veered to N.&nbsp;W. Being at this time in the latitude
of 56° 4ʹ S. longitude 53° 36ʹ W., we sounded, but
found no bottom with a line of one hundred and
thirty fathoms. I still kept the wind on the larboard-tack,
having a gentle breeze and pleasant weather.
On the 8th, at noon, a bed of sea-weed passed the
ship. In the afternoon, in the latitude of 55° 4ʹ,
longitude 51° 45ʹ W., the variation was 20° 4ʹ E.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 9th, wind at N.&nbsp;E. attended with thick hazy
weather; saw a seal, and a piece of sea-weed. At
noon, latitude 55° 12ʹ S. longitude 50° 15ʹ W., the
wind and weather continuing the same till towards
midnight, when the latter cleared up, and the former
veered to west, and blew a gentle gale. We continued
to ply till two o’clock the next morning, when
we bore away E., and at eight, E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E.; at noon,
observed in latitude 54° 35ʹ S., longitude 47° 56ʹ W.,
a great many albatrosses and blue peterels about the
ship. I now steered E., and the next morning, in
the latitude of 54° 38ʹ, longitude 45° 10ʹ W., the
variation was 19° 25ʹ E. In the afternoon saw several
penguins, and some pieces of weed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having spent the night lying to, on the 12th, at
day-break, we bore away, and steered east northerly,
with a fine fresh breeze at W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W.; at noon observed
in latitude 54° 28ʹ S., longitude in 42° 8ʹ W.; that is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>near 3° E. of the situation in which Mr. Dalrymple
places the N.&nbsp;E. point of the Gulph of St. Sebastian;
but we had no other signs of land than seeing a seal
and a few penguins; on the contrary we had a swell
from E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. which would hardly have been, if any
extensive track of land lay in that direction. In the
evening the gale abated, and at midnight it fell calm.</p>

<p class='c000'>The calm, attended by a thick fog, continued till
six next morning, when we got a wind at E., but the
fog still prevailed. We stood to the S. till noon,
when, being in the latitude of 55° 7ʹ, we tacked and
stretched to the N. with a fresh breeze at E. by S.
and E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. cloudy weather; saw several penguins
and a snow-peterel, which we looked on to be signs
of the vicinity of ice. The air too was much colder
than we had felt it since we left New Zealand. In
the afternoon the wind veered to S.&nbsp;E. and in the
night to S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. and blew fresh; with which we stood
to the N.&nbsp;E.</p>

<p class='c000'>At nine o’clock the next morning we saw an island
of ice as we then thought; but at noon were doubtful
whether it was ice or land. At this time it bore
E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span>
S., distant thirteen leagues; our latitude was
53°
<span class='nobreak'>56<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>ʹ,</span>
longitude 39° 24ʹ W.; several penguins,
small divers, a snow-peterel, and a vast number of
blue peterels about the ship. We had but little wind
all the morning; and at two P.&nbsp;M. it fell calm. It
was now no longer doubted that it was land, and not
ice, which we had in sight. It was, however, in a
manner wholly covered with snow. We were farther
confirmed in our judgment of its being land, by
finding soundings at one hundred and seventy-five
fathoms, a muddy bottom. The land at this time
bore E. by S., about twelve leagues distant. At six
o’clock the calm was succeeded by a breeze at N.&nbsp;E.,
with which we stood to S.&nbsp;E. At first it blew a
gentle gale, but afterwards increased so as to bring
us under double-reefed topsails, and was attended
with snow and sleet.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>We continued to stand to the S.&nbsp;E. till seven in the
morning on the 15th, when the wind veering to the
S.&nbsp;E. we tacked and stood to the N. A little before
we tacked, we saw the land bearing E. by N. At
noon the mercury in the thermometer was at
<span class='nobreak'>35<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>°.</span>
The wind blew in squalls, attended with snow and
sleet, and we had a great sea to encounter. At a
lee-lurch which the ship took, Mr. Wales observed
her to lie down 42°. At half-past four P.&nbsp;M. we
took in the top-sails, got down top-gallant yards,
wore the ship, and stood to the S.&nbsp;W. under two
courses. At midnight the storm abated, so that we
could carry the top-sails double reefed.</p>

<p class='c000'>At four in the morning of the 16th, we wore and
stood to the E., with the wind at S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., a moderate
breeze and fair; at eight o’clock saw the land extending
from E. by N. to N.&nbsp;E. by N.; loosed a reef
out of each top-sail, got top-gallant yards across, and
set the sails. At noon observed in latitude 54°
<span class='nobreak'>25<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>ʹ;</span>
longitude 38° 18ʹ W. In this situation we had one
hundred and ten fathoms’ water; and the land extended
from N.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W. to E., eight leagues distant.
The northern extreme was the same that we first
discovered, and it proved to be an island which
obtained the name of Willis’s Island, after the person
who first saw it.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time we had a great swell from the S.,
an indication that no land was near us in that
direction; nevertheless, the vast quantity of snow on
that in sight, induced us to think it was extensive,
and I chose to begin with exploring the northern
coast. With this view we bore up for Willis’s Island,
all sails set, having a fine gale at S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. As we
advanced to the N., we perceived another isle lying
east of Willis’s, and between it and the main. Seeing
there was a clear passage between the two isles, we
steered for it, and at five o’clock, being in the middle
of it, we found it about two miles broad.</p>

<p class='c000'>Willis’s Isle is a high rock of no great extent, near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>to which are some rocky islets. It is situated in the
latitude of 54° S., longitude 38° 23ʹ W. The other
isle, which obtained the name of Bird Isle, on account
of the vast number that were upon it, is not so
high, but of greater extent, and is close to the N.&nbsp;E.
point of the main land, which I called Cape North.</p>

<p class='c000'>The S.&nbsp;E. coast of this land, as far as we saw it,
lies in the direction of S. 50° E., and N. 50° W. It
seemed to form several bays or inlets; and we observed
huge masses of snow, or ice, in the bottoms of
them, especially in one which lies ten miles to the
S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. of Bird Isle.</p>

<p class='c000'>After getting through the passage, we found the
north coast trended E. by N. for about nine miles;
and then E. and E. southerly to Cape Buller, which
is eleven miles more. We ranged the coast, at
one league distance, till near ten o’clock, when we
brought to for the night, and, on sounding, found
fifty fathoms, a muddy bottom.</p>

<p class='c000'>At two o’clock in the morning of the 17th, we
made sail in for the land, with a fine breeze at S.&nbsp;W.;
at four, Willis’s Isle bore W. by S., distant thirty-two
miles; Cape Buller, to the west of which lie some
rocky islets, bore S.&nbsp;W. by W.; and the most advanced
point of land to the E., S. 63° E. We now
steered along the shore, at the distance of four or
five miles, till seven o’clock, when, seeing the appearance
of an inlet, we hauled in for it. As soon
as we drew near the shore, having hoisted out a boat,
I embarked in it, accompanied by Mr. Forster and
his party, with a view of reconnoitring the bay
before we ventured in with the ship. When we put
off from her, which was about four miles from the
shore, we had forty fathoms’ water. I continued to
sound as I went farther in, but found no bottom with
a line of thirty-four fathoms, which was the length of
that I had in the boat, and which also proved too
short to sound the bay, so far as I went up it. I
observed it to lie in S.&nbsp;W. by S. about two leagues,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>about two miles broad, well sheltered from all winds;
and I judged there might be good anchorage before
some sandy beaches which are on each side, and
likewise near a low flat isle, towards the head of the
bay. As I had come to a resolution not to bring the
ship in, I did not think it worth my while to go and
examine these places; for it did not seem probable
that any one would ever be benefited by the discovery.
I landed in three different places, displayed
our colours, and took possession of the country in
his Majesty’s name, under a discharge of small arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>I judged that the tide rises about four or five feet,
and that it is high water on the full and change days
about eleven o’clock.</p>

<p class='c000'>The head of the bay, as well as two places on each
side, was terminated by perpendicular ice-cliffs of
considerable height. Pieces were continually breaking
off, and floating out to sea; and a great fall
happened while we were in the bay, which made a
noise like cannon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inner parts of the country were not less
savage and horrible. The wild rocks raised their
lofty summits, till they were lost in the clouds, and
the valleys lay covered with everlasting snow. Not
a tree was to be seen, nor a shrub even big enough
to make a toothpick. The only vegetation we met
with, was a coarse strong-bladed grass, growing in
tufts, wild burnet, and a plant like moss, which
sprung from the rocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seals, or sea bears, were pretty numerous. They
were smaller than those at Staten Land; perhaps the
most of those we saw were females; for the shore
swarmed with young cubs. We saw none of that
sort which we call lions; but there were some of
those which the writer of Lord Anson’s Voyage
describes under that name; at least they appeared to
us to be of the same sort; and are, in my opinion, very
improperly called lions; for I could not see any
grounds for the comparison.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Here were several flocks of penguins, the largest
I ever saw; some, which we brought on board,
weighed from twenty-nine to thirty-eight pounds.
It appears by Bougainville’s account of the animals
of Falkland Islands, that this penguin is there; and I
think it is very well described by him under the name
of First Class of Penguins.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c009'><sup>[17]</sup></a> The Oceanic birds
were albatrosses, common gulls, and that sort which
I call Port Egmont hens, terns, shags, divers,
the new white bird, and a small bird like those of
the Cape of Good Hope, called yellow birds;
which, having shot two, we found most delicious
food.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the land birds we saw consisted of a few small
larks; nor did we meet with any quadrupeds. Mr.
Forster, indeed, observed some dung, which he judged
to come from a fox, or some such animal. The
lands, or rather rocks, bordering on the sea-coast,
were not covered with snow like the inland parts;
but all the vegetation we could see on the clear
places was the grass above mentioned. The rocks
seemed to contain iron. Having made the above
observations, we set out for the ship, and got on
board a little after twelve o’clock, with a quantity of
seals and penguins, an acceptable present to the
crew.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must not, however, be understood that we were
in want of provisions: we had yet plenty of every
kind; and since we had been on this coast, I had
ordered, in addition to the common allowance, wheat
to be boiled every morning for breakfast; but any
kind of fresh meat was preferred by most on board to
salt. For my own part, I was now, for the first time,
heartily tired of salt meat of every kind; and though
the flesh of the penguins could scarcely vie with
bullock’s liver, its being fresh was sufficient to make
it go down. I called the bay we had been in, Possession
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Bay. It is situated in the latitude of 54° 5ʹ S.,
longitude 37° 18ʹ W., and eleven leagues to the east of
Cape North. A few miles to the west of Possession
Bay, between it and Cape Buller, lies the Bay of Isles;
so named on account of several small isles lying
in and before it.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the boat was hoisted in, we made sail
along the coast to the E. with a fine breeze at W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W.
From Cape Buller, the direction of the coast is S.
72° 30ʹ E., for the space of eleven or twelve leagues,
to a projecting point, which obtained the name of
Cape Saunders. Beyond this Cape, is a pretty large
bay, which I named Cumberland Bay. In several
parts in the bottom of it, as also in some others of
less extent, lying between Cape Saunders and Possession
Bay, were vast tracks of frozen snow, or ice
not yet broken loose. At eight o’clock, being just
past Cumberland Bay, and falling little wind, we
hauled off the coast, from which we were distant
about four miles, and found one hundred and ten
fathoms’ water.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had variable light airs and calms till six o’clock
the next morning, when the wind fixed at N. and
blew a gentle breeze; but it lasted no longer than
ten o’clock, when it fell almost to a calm. At noon,
observed in latitude 54° 30ʹ S., being then about
two or three leagues from the coast, which extended
from N. 59° W. to S. 13° W. The land in this last
direction was an isle, which seemed to be the extremity
of the coast to the east. The nearest land
to us being a projecting point which terminated
in a round hillock, was, on account of the day,
named Cape Charlotte. On the west side of Cape
Charlotte lies a bay, which obtained the name of
Royal Bay, and the west point of it was named
Cape George. It is the east point of Cumberland
Bay, and lies in the direction of S.&nbsp;E. by E. from
Cape Saunders, distant seven leagues. Cape George
and Cape Charlotte lie in the direction of S. 37° E.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>and N. 37° W., distant six leagues from each other.
The isle above mentioned, which was called Cooper’s
Isle, after my first lieutenant, lies in the direction of
S. by E., distant eight leagues from Cape Charlotte.
The coast between them forms a large bay, to which
I gave the name of Sandwich. The wind being
variable all the afternoon, we advanced but little; in
the night it fixed at S. and S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W., and blew a gentle
gale attended with showers of snow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 19th was wholly spent in plying, the wind continuing
at S. and S.&nbsp;W., clear pleasant weather, but
cold. At sun-rise, a new land was seen bearing
S.&nbsp;E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
E. It first appeared in a single hill, like
a sugar-loaf; some time after, other detached
pieces appeared above the horizon near the hill.
At noon observed in the latitude 54° 42ʹ 30ʺ S.,
Cape Charlotte bearing N. 38° W., distant four
leagues; and Cooper’s Isle S. 31° W. In this situation,
a lurking rock, which lies off Sandwich Bay,
five miles from the land, bore W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
N., distant one
mile, and near this rock were several breakers. In
the afternoon we had a prospect of a ridge of mountains
behind Sandwich Bay, whose lofty and icy
summits were elevated high above the clouds. The
wind continued at S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. till six o’clock, when it
fell to a calm. At this time Cape Charlotte bore N.
31° W., and Cooper’s Island W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. In this situation
we found the variation, by the azimuths, to be
11° 39ʹ, and by the amplitude, ll° 12ʹ E. At ten
o’clock, a light breeze springing up at N., we steered
to the S. till twelve, and then brought to for the
night.</p>

<p class='c000'>At two o’clock in the morning of the 20th, we
made sail to S.&nbsp;W., round Cooper’s Island. It is a
rock of considerable height, about five miles in circuit,
and one mile from the main. At this isle the
main coast takes a S.&nbsp;W. direction for the space of
four or five leagues to a point, which I called Cape
Disappointment. Off that, are three small isles, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>southernmost of which is green, low, and flat, and
lies one league from the Cape.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we advanced to S.&nbsp;W., land opened off this
point, in the direction of N. 60° West, and nine
leagues beyond it. It proved an island quite detached
from the main, and obtained the name of Pickersgill
Island, after my third officer. Soon after, a point
of the main, beyond this island, came in sight, in the
direction of N. 55° W.; which exactly united the coast
at the very point we had seen, and taken the bearing
of, the day we first came in with it, and proved
to a demonstration that this land, which we had taken
for part of a great continent, was no more than an
island of seventy leagues in circuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who would have thought that an island of no
greater extent than this, situated between the latitude
of 54° and 55°, should, in the very height of
summer, be in a manner wholly covered many fathoms
deep with frozen snow, but more especially
the S.&nbsp;W. coast? The very sides and craggy summits
of the lofty mountains were cased with snow and
ice; but the quantity which lay in the valleys is incredible;
and at the bottom of the bays, the coast
was terminated by a wall of ice of considerable
height. It can hardly be doubted that a great
deal of ice is formed here in the winter, which in the
spring is broken off and dispersed over the sea; but
this island cannot produce the ten-thousandth part of
what we saw; so that either there must be more
land, or the ice is formed without it. These reflections
led me to think that the land we had seen the
preceding day might belong to an extensive track;
and I still had hopes of discovering a continent.
I must confess the disappointment I now met
with, did not affect me much, for to judge of the
bulk by the sample, it would not be worth the
discovery.</p>

<p class='c000'>I called this land the Isle of Georgia in honour of
his Majesty. It is situated between the latitude of 53°
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>57ʹ and 54° 57ʹ S.; and between 38° 13ʹ and 35° 34ʹ
W. longitude. It extends S.&nbsp;E. by E., and N.&nbsp;W. by W.
and is thirty-one leagues long in that direction; and
its greatest breadth is about ten leagues. It seems to
abound with bays and harbours, the N.&nbsp;E. coast
especially; but the vast quantity of ice must
render them inaccessible the greatest part of the
year; or, at least, it must be dangerous lying in
them, on account of the breaking up of the ice-cliffs.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is remarkable that we did not see a river or
stream of fresh water, on the whole coast. I think
it highly probable that there are no perennial springs
in the country; and that the interior parts, as
being much elevated, never enjoy heat enough to
melt the snow in such quantities as to produce a
river or stream of water. The coast alone receives
warmth sufficient to melt the snow, and this only on
the N.&nbsp;E. side; for the other, besides being exposed to
the cold south winds, is in a great degree deprived
of the sun’s rays by the uncommon height of the
mountains.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was from a persuasion that the sea-coast of a
land situated in the latitude of 54°, could not, in
the very height of summer, be wholly covered with
snow, that I supposed Bouvet’s discovery to be large
islands of ice. But after I had seen this land, I no
longer hesitated about the existence of Cape Circumcision;
nor did I doubt that I should find more land
than I should have time to explore. With these
ideas I quitted this coast, and directed my course
to the E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. for the land we had seen the preceding
day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind was very variable till noon, when it fixed
at N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E., and blew a gentle gale; but it increased
in such a manner, that, before three o’clock, we were
reduced to our two courses, and obliged to strike top-gallant
yards. We were very fortunate in getting
clear of the land before this gale overtook us, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>being hard to say what might have been the consequence
had it come on while we were on the north
coast. This storm was of short duration, for at eight
o’clock it began to abate, and at midnight it was little
wind. We then took the opportunity to sound, but
found no bottom with a line of an hundred and eighty
fathoms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next day the storm was succeeded by a thick fog,
attended with rain; the wind veered to N.&nbsp;W., and
at five in the morning it fell calm, which continued
till eight, and then we got a breeze southerly, with
which we stood to the east till three in the afternoon.
The weather then coming somewhat clear, we made
sail and steered north in search of the land; but at
half past six we were again involved in a thick mist,
which made it necessary to haul the wind, and spend
the night in making short boards.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had variable light airs, next to a calm, and thick
foggy weather, till half-past seven o’clock in the evening
of the 22d, when we got a fine breeze at N.,
and the weather was so clear that we could see two
or three leagues round us. We seized the opportunity,
and steered to west; judging we were to
the east of the land. After running ten miles to
the west, the weather became again foggy, and
we hauled the wind, and spent the night under
top-sails.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning, at six o’clock, the fog clearing away
so that we could see three or four miles, I took the
opportunity to steer again to the W., with the wind
at E., a fresh breeze; but two hours after, a thick
fog once more obliged us to haul the wind to the
south. At eleven o’clock, a short interval of clear
weather gave us a view of three or four rocky islets, extending
from S.&nbsp;E. to E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E., two or three miles distant;
but we did not see the Sugar-loaf Peak before-mentioned.
Indeed, two or three miles was the extent
of our horizon.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were well assured that this was the land we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>had seen before, which we had now been quite
round: and therefore it could be no more than a few
detached rocks, receptacles for birds, of which we now
saw vast numbers, especially shags, who gave us notice
of the vicinity of land before we saw it. These
rocks lie in the latitude of 55° S. and S. 75° E., distant
twelve leagues from Cooper’s Isle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The interval of clear weather was of very short
duration, before we had as thick a fog as ever, attended
with rain; on which we tacked in sixty
fathoms’ water, and stood to the north. Thus we
spent our time involved in a continual thick mist;
and for aught we knew, surrounded by dangerous
rocks. The shags and soundings were our best
pilots; for after we had stood a few miles to the
north, we got out of soundings, and saw no more
shags. The succeeding day and night were spent in
making short boards; and at eight o’clock on the
24th, judging ourselves not far from the rocks by
some straggling shags which came about us, we
sounded in sixty fathoms’ water, the bottom stones and
broken shells. Soon after, we saw the rocks bearing
S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W., four miles distant, but still we
did <a id='not'></a>not see the Peak. It was, no doubt, beyond
our horizon, which was limited to a short distance;
and, indeed, we had but a transient sight
of the other rocks, before they were again lost in
the fog.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a light air of wind at N., and a great swell
from N.&nbsp;E., we were able to clear the rocks to the W.;
and at four in the P.&nbsp;M., judging ourselves to be
three or four leagues E. and W. of them, I steered
S., being quite tired with cruizing about them in a
thick fog; nor was it worth my while to spend any
more time in waiting for clear weather, only for the
sake of having a good sight of a few straggling rocks.
At seven o’clock, we had at intervals a clear sky to
the W., which gave us a sight of the mountains of
the Isle of Georgia, bearing W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W., about eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>leagues distant. At eight o’clock we steered S.&nbsp;E.
by S., and at ten S.&nbsp;E. by E., with a fresh breeze at
N., attended with a very thick fog; but we were, in
some measure, acquainted with the sea over which
we were running. The rocks above-mentioned obtained
the name of Clerke’s Rocks, after my second
officer, he being the first who saw them.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>On the 25th we steered E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., with a fresh gale at
N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E., attended with foggy weather, till towards
the evening, when the sky becoming clear, we found
the variation to be 9° 26ʹ E., being at this time in the
latitude of 56° 16ʹ S., longitude 32° 9ʹ W.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having continued to steer E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., with a fine
gale at N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W., till daylight next morning, on
seeing no land to the E., I gave orders to steer
S., being at this time in the latitude of 56° 33ʹ S., longitude
31° 10ʹ W. The weather continued clear,
and gave us an opportunity to observe several distances
of the sun and moon for the correcting our
longitude, which at noon was 31° 4ʹ W., the latitude
observed 57° 38ʹ S. We continued to steer to the S.
till the 27th at noon, at which time we were in the
latitude of 59° 46ʹ S., and had so thick a fog that
we could not see a ship’s length. It being no longer
safe to sail before the wind, as we were to expect
soon to fall in with ice, I therefore hauled to the E.,
having a gentle breeze at N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. Soon after, the
fog clearing away, we resumed our course to the S.
till four o’clock, when it returned again as thick as
ever, and made it necessary for us to haul upon a wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>I now reckoned we were in latitude 60° S., and
farther I did not intend to go, unless I observed
some certain signs of soon meeting with land; for
it would not have been prudent in me to have spent
my time in penetrating to the south, when it was at
least as probable that a large tract of land might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>found near Cape Circumcision. Besides, I was tired
of these high southern latitudes, where nothing was
to be found but ice and thick fogs. We had now a
long hollow swell from the W., a strong indication
that there was no land in that direction; so that I
think I may venture to assert that the extensive coast,
laid down in Mr. Dalrymple’s chart of the ocean between
Africa and America, and the Gulph of Saint
Sebastian, do not exist.</p>

<p class='c000'>At seven o’clock in the evening, the fog receding
from us a little, gave us a sight of an ice-island,
several penguins and some snow peterels; we
sounded, but found no ground at one hundred and
forty fathoms. The fog soon returning, we spent the
night in making boards over that space which we
had, in some degree, made ourselves acquainted with
in the day.</p>

<p class='c000'>At eight in the morning of the 28th, we stood to
the E., with a gentle gale at N.; the weather began
to clear up, and we found the sea strewed with large
and small ice; several penguins, snow peterels, and
other birds were seen, and some whales. Soon after
we had sun-shine, but the air was cold; the mercury
in the thermometer stood generally at thirty-five, but
at noon it was at 37°; the latitude by observation was
60° 4ʹ S., longitude 29° 23ʹ W.</p>

<p class='c000'>We continued to stand to the E. till half-past two
o’clock P.&nbsp;M., when we fell in, all at once, with a vast
number of large ice-islands, and a sea strewed with
loose ice. The weather too was become thick and
hazy, attended with drizzling rain and sleet, which
made it the more dangerous to stand in among the
ice. For this reason we tacked and stood back to
the W., with the wind at N. The ice-islands, which
at this time surrounded us, were nearly all of equal
height, and showed a flat even surface; but they were
of various extent, some being two or three miles in
circuit. The loose ice was what had broken from
these isles.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Next morning, the wind falling and veering to
S.&nbsp;W., we steered N.&nbsp;E., but this course was soon intercepted
by numerous ice-islands; and, having but
very little wind, we were obliged to steer such
courses as carried us the clearest of them; so that we
hardly made any advance, one way or other, during
the whole day. Abundance of whales and penguins
were about us all the time; and the weather fair, but
dark and gloomy.</p>

<p class='c000'>At midnight the wind began to freshen at N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E.,
with which we stood to N.&nbsp;W. till six in the morning
of the 30th, when the wind veering to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W., we
tacked and stood to N.&nbsp;E., and soon after sailed
through a good deal of loose ice, and passed two
large islands. Except a short interval of clear
weather about nine o’clock, it was continually foggy,
with either sleet or snow. At noon we were, by our
reckoning, in the latitude of 59° 30ʹ S., longitude
29° 24ʹ W.</p>

<p class='c000'>Continuing to stand to N.&nbsp;E., with a fresh breeze at
N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W., at two o’clock, we passed one of the largest
ice-islands we had seen in the voyage, and some time
after passed two others, which were much smaller.
Weather still foggy, with sleet; and the wind continued
at N. by W., with which we stood to N.&nbsp;E.
over a sea strewed with ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>At half an hour past six in the morning, as we
were standing N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. with the wind at W., the fog
very fortunately clearing away a little, we discovered
land a-head, three or four miles distant. On this we
hauled the wind to the N., but finding we could not
weather the land on this tack, we soon after tacked
in one hundred and seventy-five fathoms water, three
miles from the shore, and about half a league from
some breakers. The weather then cleared up a
little more, and gave us a tolerably good sight of the
land. That which we had fallen in with proved
three rocky islets of considerable height. The outermost
terminated in a lofty peak like a sugar-loaf, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>obtained the name of Freezeland Peak, after the man
who first discovered it. Latitude 59° S., longitude
27° W. Behind this peak, that is to the east of it,
appeared an elevated coast, whose lofty snow-clad
summits were seen above the clouds. It extended
from N. by E. to E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. and I called it Cape Bristol,
in honour of the noble family of Hervey. At the
same time another elevated coast appeared in sight,
bearing S.&nbsp;W. by S., and at noon it extended from
S.&nbsp;E. to S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W., from four to eight leagues distant;
at this time the observed latitude was 59° 13ʹ 30ʺ S.,
longitude 27° 45ʹ W. I called this land Southern
Thule, because it is the most southern land that has
ever yet been discovered. It shows a surface of vast
height, and is every where covered with snow.
Some thought they saw land in the space between
Thule and Cape Bristol. It is more than probable
that these two lands are connected, and that this
space is a deep bay, which I called Forster’s Bay.</p>

<p class='c000'>At one o’clock, finding that we could not weather
Thule, we tacked and stood to the north, and at
four, Freezeland Peak bore E., distant three or four
leagues. Soon after it fell little wind, and we were
left to the mercy of a great westerly swell, which set
right upon the shore. We sounded, but a line of
two hundred fathoms found no bottom. At eight
o’clock, the weather, which had been very hazy,
clearing up, we saw Cape Bristol bearing E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., and
terminating in a point to the north, beyond which we
could see no land. This discovery relieved us from
the fear of being carried by the swell on the most
horrible coast in the world, and we continued to stand
to the north all night, with a light breeze at W.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 1st of February, at four o’clock in the morning,
we got sight of a new coast, which at six o’clock
bore N. 60° E. It proved a high promontory, which I
named Cape Montagu, situated in latitude 58° 27ʹ S.,
longitude 26° 44ʹ W., and seven or eight leagues to
the north of Cape Bristol. We saw land from space
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>to space between them, which made me conclude
that the whole was connected. I was sorry I could
not determine this with greater certainty; but
prudence would not permit me to venture near a
coast, subject to thick fogs, on which there was no
anchorage; where every port was blocked or filled
up with ice; and the whole country, from the summits
of the mountains, down to the very brink of the
cliffs which terminate the coast, covered, many
fathoms thick, with everlasting snow. The cliffs
alone was all which was to be seen like land.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several large islands lay upon the coast; one of
which attracted my notice. It had a flat surface,
was of considerable extent both in height and circuit,
and had perpendicular sides, on which the waves of
the sea had made no impression; by which I judged
that it had not been long from land, and that it
might have lately come out of some bay on the coast,
where it had been formed.</p>

<p class='c000'>At noon we were east and west of the northern
part of Cape Montagu, distant about five leagues,
and Freezeland Peak bore S. 16° E., distant twelve
leagues; latitude observed 58° 25ʹ S. In the morning
the variation was 10° 11ʹ E. At two in the afternoon,
as we were standing to the north, with a light breeze
at S.&nbsp;W. we saw land bearing N. 25ʹ E., distant
fourteen leagues. Cape Montagu bore at this time,
S. 66° E.; at eight it bore S. 40° E.; Cape Bristol,
S. by E.; the new land extending from N. 40° to 52°
E.; and we thought we saw land still more to the E.,
and beyond it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Continuing to steer to the north all night, at six
o’clock the next morning, a new land was seen
bearing N. 12° E., about ten leagues distant. It appeared
in two hummocks just peeping above the
horizon; but we soon after lost sight of them; and
having got the wind at N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E., a fresh breeze, we
stood for the northernmost land we had seen the day
before, which at this time bore E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. We fetched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>in with it by ten o’clock, but could not weather it,
and were obliged to tack three miles from the coast,
which extended from E. by S. to S.&nbsp;E., and had much
the appearance of being an island of about eight or
ten leagues’ circuit. It shows a surface of considerable
height, whose summit was lost in the clouds,
and, like all the neighbouring lands, covered with a
sheet of snow and ice, except on a projecting point
on the north side, and two hills seen over this point,
which probably might be two islands. These only
were clear of snow, and seemed covered with a green
turf. Some large ice-islands lay to the N.&nbsp;E., and
some others to the S.</p>

<p class='c000'>We stood off till noon, and then tacked for the
land again, in order to see whether it was an island
or no. The weather was now become very hazy,
which soon turning to a thick fog, put a stop to discovery,
and made it unsafe to stand for the shore; so
that after having run the same distance in, as we had
run off, we tacked and stood to N.&nbsp;W. for the land we
had seen in the morning, which was yet at a considerable
distance. Thus we were obliged to leave
the other, under the supposition of its being an island,
which I named Saunders, after my honourable friend
Sir Charles. It is situated in the latitude of 57° 49ʹ
S., longitude 26° 44ʹ W.; and N., distant thirteen
leagues from Cape Montagu.</p>

<p class='c000'>At six o’clock in the evening, the wind shifting to
the W., we tacked, and stood to the N., and at eight the
fog clearing away, gave us a sight of Saunders’s isle,
extending from S.&nbsp;E. by S. to E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. We were still in
doubt if it were an island; for, at this time, land was
seen bearing E. by S., which might, or might not be
connected with it; it might also be the same that we
had seen the preceding evening. But, be this as it
may, it was now necessary to take a view of the land
to the north before we proceeded any farther to the
east. With this intention, we stood to the north,
having a light breeze at W. by S., which, at two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>o’clock in the morning of the 3d, was succeeded by
a calm that continued till eight, when we got the
wind at E. by S., attended with hazy weather. At
this time we saw the land we were looking for, and
which proved to be two isles. The day on which
they were discovered, was the occasion of calling
them Candlemas isles; latitude 57° 11ʹ S., longitude
27° 6ʹ W. They are of no great extent, but of considerable
height, and were covered with snow. A
small rock was seen between them, and perhaps there
may be more; for the weather was so hazy that we
soon lost sight of the islands, and did not see them
again till noon, at which time they bore W., distant
three or four leagues.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the wind kept veering to the S. we were obliged
to stand to the N.&nbsp;E., in which route we met with
several large ice-islands, loose ice, and many penguins;
and, at midnight, came at once into water
uncommonly white, which alarmed the officer of the
watch so much that he tacked the ship instantly.
Some thought it was a float of ice, others that it was
shallow water; but as it proved neither, probably it
was a shoal of fish.</p>

<p class='c000'>We stood to the south till two o’clock next morning,
when we resumed our course to the E., with a
faint breeze at S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., which having ended in a calm,
at six, I took the opportunity of putting a boat in
the water to try if there were any current; and the
trial proved there was none. Some whales were
playing about us, and abundance of penguins; a few
of the latter were shot, and they proved to be of the
same sort that we had seen among the ice before, and
different both from those on Staten Land, and from
those at the isle of Georgia. It is remarkable, that
we had not seen a seal since we left that coast. At
<a id='noon'></a>noon we were in the latitude of 56° 44ʹ S., longitude
25° 33ʹ W. At this time we got a breeze at E.,
with which we stood to the S., with a view of gaining
the coast we had left; but at eight o’clock the wind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>shifted to the S., and made it necessary to tack and
stand to the E; in which course we met with several
ice-islands and some loose ice, the weather continuing
hazy with snow and rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>No penguins were seen on the 5th, which made
me conjecture that we were leaving the land behind
us, and that we had already seen its northern extremity.
At noon we were in the latitude of 57° 8ʹ S.,
longitude 23° 34ʹ W., which was 3° of longitude to
the east of Saunders’s isle. In the afternoon the
wind shifted to the W., this enabled us to stretch to
the S., and to get into the latitude of the land, that,
if it took an east direction, we might again fall in
with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>We continued to steer to the S. and S.&nbsp;E. till next
day at noon, at which time we were in the latitude
of 58° 15ʹ S., longitude 21° 34ʹ W., and seeing neither
land nor signs of any, I concluded that what we had
seen, which I named Sandwich Land, was either a
group of islands, or else a point of the continent;
for I firmly believe that there is a track of land near
the pole which is the source of most of the ice that
is spread over this vast Southern Ocean. I also
think it probable that it extends farthest to the
north opposite the southern Atlantic and Indian
Oceans, because ice was always found by us farther
to the north in these oceans than any where else,
which I judge could not be, if there were not land to
the S.; I mean a land of considerable extent. For
if we suppose that no such land exists, and that ice
may be formed without it, it will follow of course
that the cold ought to be every where nearly equal
round the pole, as far as 70° or 60° of latitude, or so
far as to be beyond the influence of any of the known
continents; consequently we ought to see ice every
where under the same parallel, or near it; and yet
the contrary has been found. Very few ships have
met with ice going round Cape Horn; and we saw
but little below the sixtieth degree of latitude, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Southern Pacific Ocean. Whereas in this ocean,
between the meridian of 40° W. and 50° or 60° E., we
found ice as far N. as 51°. Bouvet met with some
in 48°; and others have seen it in a much lower
latitude. It is true, however, that the greatest part
of this southern continent (supposing there is one)
must lie within the polar circle, where the sea is so
pestered with ice that the land is thereby inaccessible.
The risk one runs in exploring a coast, in these
unknown and icy seas, is so very great, that I can
be bold enough to say that no man will ever venture
farther than I have done; and that the lands which
may lie to the south will never be explored. Thick
fogs, snow-storms, intense cold, and every other
thing that can render navigation dangerous, must be
encountered; and these difficulties are greatly
heightened, by the inexpressibly horrid aspect of the
country; a country doomed by nature never once to
feel the warmth of the sun’s rays, but to lie buried in
everlasting snow and ice. The ports which may be
on the coast, are, in a manner, wholly filled up with
frozen snow of vast thickness; but if any should be
so far open as to invite a ship into it, she would run
a risk of being fixed there for ever, or of coming
out in an ice-island. The islands and floats on the
coast, the great falls from the ice-cliffs in the port, or
a heavy snow storm attended with a sharp frost,
would be equally fatal.</p>

<p class='c000'>After such an explanation as this, the reader must
not expect to find me much farther to the south. It
was, however, not for want of inclination, but for
other reasons. It would have been rashness in me
to have risked all that had been done during the
voyage, in discovering and exploring a coast, which,
when discovered and explored, would have answered
no end whatever, or have been of the least use, either
to navigation or geography, or indeed to any other
science. Bouvet’s discovery was yet before us, the
existence of which was to be cleared up; and besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>all this, we were not now in a condition to undertake
great things; nor indeed was there time, had we
been ever so well provided.</p>

<p class='c000'>These reasons induced me to alter the course to
E., with a very strong gale at N., attended with an
exceedingly heavy fall of snow. The quantity which
lodged in our sails was so great, that we were frequently
obliged to throw the ship up in the wind to
shake it out of them, otherwise neither they nor the
ship could have supported the weight. In the
evening it ceased to snow; the weather cleared up;
the wind backed to the W.; and we spent the night
in making two short boards, under close-reefed top-sails
and fore-sail.</p>

<p class='c000'>At day-break on the 7th, we resumed our course
to the E., with a very fresh gale at S.&nbsp;W. by W.,
attended by a high sea from the same direction. In
the afternoon, being in the latitude of 58° 24ʹ S.,
longitude 16° 19ʹ W., the variation was 1° 52ʹ E.
Only three ice-islands seen this day. At eight o’clock,
shortened sail, and hauled the wind to the S.&nbsp;E. for
the night, in which we had several showers of snow
and sleet.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the eighth, at day-light, we resumed our east
course with a gentle breeze and fair weather. After
sun-rise, being then in the latitude of 58° 30ʹ S.,
longitude 15° 14ʹ W.; the variation, by the mean
results of two compasses, was 2° 43ʹ E. These observations
were more to be depended on than those
made the night before, there being much less sea
now than then. In the afternoon, we passed three
ice-islands. This night was spent as the preceding.</p>

<p class='c000'>At six next morning, being in the latitude of
58° 27ʹ S., longitude 13° 4ʹ W., the variation was 26ʹ E.,
and in the afternoon, being in the same latitude, and
about a quarter of a degree more to the E., it was
2ʹ W. Therefore this last situation must be in or
near the line in which the compass has no variation.
We had a calm the most part of the day. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>weather fair and clear, excepting now and then a
snow shower. The mercury in the thermometer at
noon rose to 40; whereas for several days before, it
had been no higher than 36 or 38. We had several
ice-islands in sight, but no one thing that could induce
us to think that any land was in our neighbourhood.
At eight in the evening, a breeze sprung up
at S.&nbsp;E., with which we stood to N.&nbsp;E.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the night the wind freshened and veered
to south, which enabled us to steer east. The wind
was attended with showers of sleet and snow till day-light,
when the weather became fair, but piercing
cold, so that the water on deck was frozen, and at
noon the mercury in the thermometer was no higher
than
<span class='nobreak'>34<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>.</span>
At six o’clock in the morning, the variation
was 23ʹ west, being then in the latitude of 58° 15ʹ
S., longitude 11° 41ʹ W., and at six in the evening,
being in the same latitude, and in the longitude of
9° 24ʹ W., it was 1° 51ʹ W. In the evening the wind
abated; and during the night it was variable between
south and west. Ice-islands continually in sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 11th, wind westerly, light airs attended
with heavy showers of snow in the morning; but, as
the day advanced, the weather became fair, clear,
and serene. Still continuing to steer east, at noon
we observed in latitude 58° 11ʹ, longitude at the same
time 7° 55ʹ west. Thermometer
<span class='nobreak'>34<sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>.</span>
In the afternoon
we had two hours’ calm, after which we had
faint breezes between the N.&nbsp;E. and S.&nbsp;E.</p>

<p class='c000'>At six o’clock in the morning of the 12th, being
in the latitude of 58° 23ʹ S., longitude 6° 54ʹ W., the
variation was 3° 23ʹ W. We had variable light airs
next to a calm all this day, and the weather was fair
and clear till towards the evening, when it became
cloudy, with snow showers, and the air very cold.
Ice-islands continually in sight; most of them small
and breaking to pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the afternoon of the 13th the wind increased,
the sky became clouded, and soon after we had a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>heavy fall of snow, which continued till eight or nine
o’clock in the evening, when the wind abating and
veering to S.&nbsp;E., the sky cleared up, and we had a fair
night, attended with so sharp a frost, that the water
in all our vessels on deck was next morning covered
with a sheet of ice. The mercury in the thermometer
was as low as 29°, which is 3° below freezing, or
rather 4; for we generally found the water freeze
when the mercury stood at 33°.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards noon on the 14th, the wind veering to
the south, increased to a very strong gale, and blew
in heavy squalls, attended with snow. At intervals,
between the squalls, the weather was fair and clear,
but exceedingly cold. We continued to steer east,
inclining a little to the north, and in the afternoon
crossed the first meridian, or that of Greenwich, in
the latitude of 57° 50ʹ S. At eight in the evening,
we close-reefed the top-sails, took in the main-sail,
and steered east, with a very hard gale at S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W.,
with a high sea from the same direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>At day-break on the 15th, we set the main-sail,
loosed a reef out of each top-sail, and with a very
strong gale at S.&nbsp;W. and fair weather, steered E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E.
till noon, at which time we were in the latitude of
56° 37ʹ S., longitude 4° 11ʹ east, when we pointed to
the N.&nbsp;E., in order to get into the latitude of Cape
Circumcision. Some large ice-islands were in sight,
and the air was nearly as cold as on the preceding
day. At eight o’clock in the evening, shortened sail,
and at eleven hauled the wind to the N.&nbsp;W., not daring
to stand on in the night, which was foggy, with snow-showers,
and a smart frost.</p>

<p class='c000'>At day-break on the 16th, we bore away N.&nbsp;E.
with a light breeze at west, which, at noon, was succeeded
by a calm and fair weather. Our latitude at
this time was 55° 26ʹ S., longitude 5° 52ʹ east, in which
situation we had a great swell from the southward,
but no ice in sight. At one o’clock in the P.&nbsp;M., a
breeze springing up at E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E., we stood to S.&nbsp;E. till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>six, then tacked, and stood to the north, under double-reefed
top-sails and courses, having a very fresh
gale, attended with snow and sleet, which fixed to the
masts and rigging as it fell, and coated the whole
with ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 17th the wind continued veering by little
and little to the south, till midnight, when it fixed
at S.&nbsp;W. Being at this time in the latitude of 54° 20ʹ
S., longitude 6° 33ʹ east, I steered east, having a prodigious
high sea from the south, which assured us no
land was near in that direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the morning of the 18th it ceased to snow; the
weather became fair and clear; and we found the
variation to be 13° 44ʹ west. At noon we were in the
latitude of 54° 25ʹ, longitude 8° 46ʹ east. I thought
this a good latitude to keep in, to look for Cape Circumcision;
because, if the land had ever so little
extent in the direction of north and south, we could
not miss seeing it, as the northern point is said to lie
in 54°. We had yet a great swell from the south, so
that I was now well assured it could only be an
island; and it was of no consequence which side we
fell in with. In the evening Mr. Wales made several
observations of the moon, and stars Regulus and
Spica; the mean results, at four o’clock, when the
observations were made, for finding the time by the
watch, gave 9° 15ʹ 20ʺ east longitude. The watch
at the same time gave 9° 36ʹ 45ʺ. Soon after the variation
was found to be 13° 10ʹ west. It is nearly in
this situation that Mr. Bouvet had 1° east. I cannot
suppose that the variation has altered so much since
that time; but rather think he had made some mistake
in his observations. That there could be none
in ours was certain, from the uniformity for some
time past. Besides, we found 12° 8ʹ west, variation,
nearly under this meridian, in January, 1773. During
the night the wind veered round by the N.&nbsp;W. to
N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E., and blew a fresh gale.</p>

<p class='c000'>At eight in the morning of the 19th, we saw the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>appearance of land in the direction of E. by S. or
that of our course; but it proved a mere fog-bank,
and soon after dispersed. We continued to steer E.
by S. and S.&nbsp;E. till seven o’clock in the evening,
when, being in the latitude of 54° 42ʹ S., longitude
13° 3ʹ E., and the wind having veered to N.&nbsp;E., we
tacked and stood to N.&nbsp;W. under close-reefed top-sails
and courses; having a very strong gale, attended
with snow showers.</p>

<p class='c000'>At four o’clock next morning, being in the latitude
of 54° 30ʹ S., longitude 12° 33ʹ E., we tacked, and
stretched to N.&nbsp;E., with a fresh gale at S.&nbsp;W., attended
with snow-showers and sleet. At noon, being in the
latitude of 54° 8ʹ S., longitude 12° 59ʹ E., with a fresh
gale at W. by N. and tolerably clear weather, we
steered E. till ten o’clock in the evening, when we
brought to, lest we might pass any land in the night,
of which we however had not the least signs.</p>

<p class='c000'>At day-break, having made sail, we bore away
east, and at noon observed in latitude 54° 16ʹ S., longitude
16° 13ʹ E., which is 5° to the east of the longitude
in which Cape Circumcision is said to lie; so
that we began to think there was no such land in existence.
I however continued to steer east, inclining
a little to the south, till four o’clock in the afternoon
of the next day, when we were in latitude of
54° 24ʹ S., longitude 19° 18ʹ E.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had now run down thirteen degrees of longitude,
in the very latitude assigned for Bouvet’s Land;
I was therefore well assured that what he had seen
could be nothing but an island of ice; for, if it had
been land, it is hardly possible we could have missed
it, though it were ever so small. Besides, from the
time of leaving the southern lands, we had not met
with the least signs of any other. But even suppose
we had, it would have been no proof of the existence
of Cape Circumcision; for I am well assured that
neither seals, nor penguins, nor any of the oceanic
birds, are indubitable signs of the vicinity of land. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>will allow that they are found on the coasts of all these
southern lands; but are they not also to be found in
all parts of the southern ocean? There are, however,
some oceanic or aquatic birds which point out
the vicinity of land; especially shags, which seldom
go out of sight of it; and gannets, boobies, and
men of war birds, I believe, seldom go very far out
to sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we were now no more than two degrees of longitude
from our route to the south, when we left the
Cape of Good Hope, it was to no purpose to proceed
any further to the east under this parallel, knowing
that no land could be there. But an opportunity
now offering of clearing up some doubts of our having
seen land farther to the south, I steered S.&nbsp;E. to
get into the situation in which it was supposed to lie.</p>

<p class='c000'>We continued this course till four o’clock the next
morning, and then S.&nbsp;E. by E. and E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. till eight
in the evening, at which time we were in the latitude
of 55° 25ʹ S., longitude 23° 22ʹ E., both deduced
from observations made the same day; for, in the
morning, the sky was clear at intervals, and afforded
an opportunity to observe several distances of the
sun and moon, which we had not been able to do for
some time past, having had a constant succession of
bad weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having now run over the place where the land was
supposed to lie, without seeing the least signs of any,
it was no longer to be doubted but that the ice-islands
had deceived us as well as Mr. Bouvet. The wind by
this time having veered to the north, and increased
to a perfect storm, attended as usual with snow and
sleet, we handed the top-sails, and hauled up E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E.
under the courses. During the night the wind abated,
and veered to N.&nbsp;W., which enabled us to steer more
to the north, having no business farther south.</p>

  <h2 id='b4c7' class='c004'>CHAP. VII.<br /> <br />HEADS OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE VOYAGE; WITH SOME CONJECTURES CONCERNING THE FORMATION OF ICE-ISLANDS; AND AN ACCOUNT OF OUR PROCEEDINGS TILL OUR ARRIVAL AT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>I had now made the circuit of the Southern Ocean
in a high latitude, and traversed it in such a manner
as to leave not the least room for the possibility
of there being a continent, unless near the pole, and
out of the reach of navigation. By twice visiting
the tropical sea, I had not only settled the situation
of some old discoveries, but made there many new
ones, and left, I conceive, very little more to be
done even in that part. Thus I flatter myself, that
the intention of the voyage has, in every respect,
been fully answered; the southern hemisphere sufficiently
explored; and a final end put to the searching
after a southern continent, which has, at times,
ingrossed the attention of some of the maritime
powers for near two centuries past, and been a favourite
theory amongst the geographers of all ages.</p>

<p class='c000'>That there may be a continent, or large tract of
land, near the pole, I will not deny; on the contrary,
I am of opinion there is; and it is probable
that we have seen a part of it. The excessive cold,
the many islands and vast floats of ice, all tend to
prove that there must be land to the south; and for
my persuasion that this southern land must lie, or extend,
farthest to the north, opposite to the Southern
Atlantic and Indian Oceans, I have already assigned
some reasons; to which I may add the greater degree
of cold experienced by us in these seas, than in
the Southern Pacific Ocean under the same parallels
of latitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this last ocean, the mercury in the thermometer
seldom fell so low as the freezing point, till we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>in 60° and upwards; whereas in the others it fell as
low in the latitude of 54°. This was certainly owing
to there being a greater quantity of ice, and to its
extending farther to the north, in these two seas than
in the South Pacific; and if ice be first formed at, or
near land, of which I have no doubt, it will follow
that the land also extends farther north.</p>

<p class='c000'>The formation or coagulation of ice-islands, has
not, to my knowledge, been thoroughly investigated.
Some have supposed them to be formed by
the freezing of the water at the mouths of large rivers,
or great cataracts, where they accumulate till
they are broken off by their own weight. My observations
will not allow me to acquiesce in this opinion;
because we never found any of the ice which we took
up incorporated with earth, or any of its produce, as
I think it must have been, had it been coagulated in
land waters. It is a doubt with me, whether there
be any rivers in these countries. It is certain, that
we saw not a river, or stream of water, on all the
coast of Georgia, nor on any of the southern lands.
Nor did we ever see a stream of water run from any
of the ice-islands. How are we then to suppose that
there are large rivers? The valleys are covered, many
fathoms deep, with everlasting snow; and, at the
sea, they terminate in icy cliffs of vast height. It
is here where the ice-islands are formed; not from
streams of water, but from consolidated snow and
sleet, which is almost continually falling or drifting
down from the mountains, especially in the winter,
when the frost must be intense. During that season,
the ice-cliffs must so accumulate as to fill up all the
bays, be they ever so large. This is a fact which
cannot be doubted, as we have seen it so in summer.
These cliffs accumulate by continual falls of snow,
and what drifts from the mountains, till they are no
longer able to support their own weight; and then
large pieces break off, which we call ice-islands.
Such as have a flat even surface, must be of the ice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>formed in the bays, and before the flat valleys; the
others, which have a tapering unequal surface, must
be formed on, or under, the side of a coast composed
of pointed rocks and precipices, or some such uneven
surface. For we cannot suppose that snow alone, as
it falls, can form, on a plain surface, such as the sea,
such a variety of high peaks and hills as we saw on
many of the ice isles. It is certainly more reasonable
to believe that they are formed on a coast whose
surface is something similar to theirs. I have observed
that all the ice-islands of any extent, and before
they begin to break to pieces, are terminated by perpendicular
cliffs of clear ice or frozen snow, always
on one or more sides, but most generally all round.
Many, and those of the largest size, which had a
hilly and spiral surface, showed a perpendicular cliff
or side from the summit of the highest peak down to
its base. This to me was a convincing proof, that
these, as well as the flat isles, must have broken off
from substances like themselves, that is, from some
large tract of ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I consider the vast quantity of ice we saw,
and the vicinity of the places to the pole where it is
formed, and where the degrees of longitude are very
small, I am led to believe that these ice-cliffs extend
a good way into the sea, in some parts, especially in
such as are sheltered from the violence of the winds.
It may even be doubted if ever the wind is violent in
the very high latitudes. And that the sea will
freeze over, or the snow that falls upon it, which
amounts to the same thing, we have instances in the
northern hemisphere. The Baltic, the Gulph of St.
Laurence, the Straits of Belle-Isle, and many other
equally large seas, are frequently frozen over in
winter. Nor is this at all extraordinary, for we have
found the degree of cold at the surface of the sea,
even in summer, to be two degrees below the freezing
point; consequently nothing kept it from freezing
but the salts it contains, and the agitation of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>surface. Whenever this last ceaseth in winter, when
the frost is set in, and there comes a fall of snow, it
will freeze on the surface as it falls, and in a few
days, or perhaps in one night, form such a sheet of
ice as will not be easily broken up. Thus a foundation
will be laid for it to accumulate to any thickness
by falls of snow, without its being at all necessary
for the sea water to freeze. It may be by this means
these vast floats of low ice we find in the spring of
the year are formed, and which, after they break up,
are carried by the currents to the north. For, from
all the observations I have been able to make, the
currents every where, in the high latitudes, set to the
N., or to the N.&nbsp;E. or N.&nbsp;W.; but we have very seldom
found them considerable.</p>

<p class='c000'>If this imperfect account of the formation of these
extraordinary floating islands of ice, which is written
wholly from my own observations, does not convey
some useful hints to an abler pen, it will, however,
convey some idea of the lands where they are formed.
Lands doomed by nature to perpetual frigidness;
never to feel the warmth of the sun’s rays; whose
horrible and savage aspect I have not words to
describe. Such are the lands we have discovered;
what then may we expect those to be which lie still
farther to the south? For we may reasonably suppose
that we have seen the best, as lying most to the north.
If any one should have resolution and perseverance
to clear up this point by proceeding farther than I
have done, I shall not envy him the honour of the discovery;
but I will be bold to say, that the world will
not be benefited by it.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had, at this time, some thoughts of revisiting the
place where the French discovery is said to lie. But
then I considered that, if they had really made this
discovery, the end would be as fully answered as if I
had done it myself. We know it can only be an
island; and if we may judge from the degree of cold
we found in that latitude, it cannot be a fertile one.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Besides, this would have kept me two months longer
at sea, and in a tempestuous latitude, which we were
not in a condition to struggle with. Our sails and
rigging were so much worn, that something was
giving way every hour; and we had nothing left,
either to repair or replace them. Our provisions
were in a state of decay, and consequently afforded
little nourishment, and we had been a long time
without refreshments. My people, indeed, were
yet healthy, and would have cheerfully have gone
wherever I had thought proper to lead them; but I
dreaded the scurvy laying hold of them, at a time
when we had nothing left to remove it. I must say
farther, that it would have been cruel in me to have continued
the fatigues and hardships they were continually
exposed to longer than was absolutely necessary.
Their behaviour, throughout the whole voyage, merited
every indulgence which it was in my power to
give them. Animated by the conduct of the officers,
they showed themselves capable of surmounting every
difficulty and danger which came in their way, and
never once looked either upon the one or the other,
as being at all heightened by our separation from
our consort the Adventure.</p>

<p class='c000'>All these considerations induced me to lay aside
looking for the French discoveries, and to steer for
the Cape of Good Hope; with a resolution, however,
of looking for the isles of Denia and Marseveen,
which are laid down in Dr. Halley’s variation chart
in the latitude of
<span class='nobreak'>41<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>°</span>
S., and about 4° of longitude
to the east of the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope.
With this view I steered N.&nbsp;E., with a hard gale at
N.&nbsp;W. and thick weather; and on the 26th at noon,
we saw the last ice-island, being at this time in
the latitude of 52° 52ʹ S., longitude 26° 31ʹ E.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind abating and veering to the S., on the
1st of March, we steered W., in order to get farther
from Mr. Bouvet’s track, which was but a few degrees
to the east of us, being at this time in the latitude of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>46° 44ʹ S., longitude 33° 20ʹ E., in which situation we
found the variation to be 23° 36ʹ west. It is somewhat
remarkable, that all the time we had northerly
winds, which were regular and constant for several
days, the weather was always thick and cloudy; but,
as soon as they came S. of W. it cleared up, and
was fine and pleasant. The barometer began to rise
several days before this change happened; but
whether on account of it, or our coming northward,
cannot be determined.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind remained not long at south before it
veered round by the N.&nbsp;E. to N.&nbsp;W., blowing fresh
and by squalls, attended, as before, with rain and
thick misty weather. We had some intervals of clear
weather on the afternoon of the 3d, when we found
the variation to be 22° 26ʹ W.; latitude at this time
45° 8ʹ S., longitude 30° 50ʹ E. The following night
was very stormy; the wind blew from S.&nbsp;W. and in
excessively heavy squalls. At short intervals between
the squalls, the wind would fall almost to a calm, and
then come on again with such fury, that neither our
sails nor rigging could withstand it, several of the
sails being split, and a middle stay-sail being wholly
lost. The next morning the gale abated, and we repaired
the damage we had sustained in the best manner
we could.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 8th, being in the latitude of 41° 30ʹ S.,
longitude 26° 51ʹ E., the mercury in the thermometer
rose to 61, and we found it necessary to put on
lighter clothes. As the wind continued invariably
fixed between N.&nbsp;W. and W., we took every advantage
to get to the west, by tacking whenever it shifted
any thing in our favour; but as we had a great swell
against us, our tacks were rather disadvantageous.
We daily saw albatrosses, peterels, and other oceanic
birds; but not the least sign of land.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 11th, in the latitude of 40° 40ʹ S., longitude
23° 47ʹ E., the variation was 20° 48ʹ W. About
noon the same day, the wind shifting suddenly from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>N.&nbsp;W. to S.&nbsp;W. caused the mercury in the thermometer
to fall as suddenly from 62° to 52°; such was the
different state of the air, between a northerly and
southerly wind. The next day, having several hours
calm, we put a boat in the water, and shot some
albatrosses and peterels; which, at this time, were
highly acceptable. We were now nearly in the situation
where the isles which we were in search of, are
said to lie; however, we saw nothing that could give
us the least hope of finding them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The calm continued till five o’clock of the next
morning, when it was succeeded by a breeze at W.
by S., with which we stood to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. and at noon
observed in latitude 38° 51ʹ S. This was upwards of
thirty miles more to the north than our log gave us;
and the watch shewed that we had been set to the
east also. If these differences did not arise from
some strong current, I know not how to account for
them. Very strong currents have been found on the
African coast, between Madagascar and the Cape of
Good Hope; but I never heard of their extending
so far from the land; nor is it probable they do. I
rather suppose that this current has no connection
with that on the coast; and that we happened to fall
into some stream which is neither lasting nor regular.
But these are points which require much time to investigate,
and must therefore be left to the industry
of future navigators.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were now two degrees to the north of the parallel
in which the isles of Denia and Marseveen are
said to lie. We had seen nothing to encourage us
to persevere in looking after them; and it must have
taken up some time longer to find them, or to prove
their non-existence. Every one was impatient to get
into port, and for good reasons; as for a long time
we had had nothing but stale and salt provisions, for
which every one on board had lost all relish. These
reasons induced me to yield to the general wish, and
to steer for the Cape of Good Hope, being at this
time in the latitude of 38° 38ʹ S., longitude 23° 37ʹ E.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>The next day the observed latitude at noon was
only seventeen miles to the north of that given by
the log; so that we had either got out of the strength
of the current, or it had ceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 15th the observed latitude at noon, together
with the watch, shewed that we had had a
strong current setting to the S.&nbsp;W. the contrary direction
to what we had experienced on some of the
preceding days, as hath been mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>At day-light, on the 16th, we saw two sail in the
N.&nbsp;W. quarter standing to the westward, and one of
them shewing Dutch colours. At ten o’clock we
tacked and stood to the west also, being at this time
in the latitude of 35° 9ʹ S., longitude 22° 38ʹ E.</p>

<p class='c000'>I now, in pursuance of my instructions, demanded
of the officers and petty officers, the log-books and
journals they had kept; which were delivered to me
accordingly, and sealed up for the inspection of the
Admiralty. I also enjoined them, and the whole
crew, not to divulge where we had been, till they
had their Lordships’ permission so to do. In the
afternoon the wind veered to the west, and increased
to a hard gale, which was of short duration; for, the
next day, it fell, and at noon veered to S.&nbsp;E. At
this time we were in the latitude of 34° 49ʹ S., longitude
22° E.; and, on sounding, found fifty-six
fathoms water. In the evening we saw the land in
the direction of E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E., about six leagues distant;
and, during the forepart of the night, there was a
great fire or light upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>At day-break on the 18th, we saw the land again,
bearing N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W., six or seven leagues distant, and
the depth of water forty-eight fathoms. At nine
o’clock, having little or no wind, we hoisted out a
boat and sent on board one of the two ships before
mentioned, which were about two leagues from us;
but we were too impatient after news to regard the
distance. Soon after, a breeze sprung up at west,
with which we stood to the south; and, presently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>three sail more appeared in sight to windward, one
of which shewed English colours.</p>

<p class='c000'>At one P.&nbsp;M. the boat returned from on board the
Bownkerke Polder, Captain Cornelius Bosch, a Dutch
Indiaman from Bengal. Captain Bosch, very obligingly,
offered us sugar, arrack, and whatever he
had to spare. Our people were told by some English
seamen on board this ship, that the Adventure had
arrived at the Cape of Good Hope twelve months
ago, and that the crew of one of her boats had been
murdered and eaten by the people of New Zealand;
so that the story which we heard in Queen Charlotte’s
Sound was now no longer a mystery.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had light airs, next to a calm, till ten o’clock
the next morning, when a breeze sprung up at west,
and the English ship, which was to windward, bore
down to us. She proved to be the True Briton, Captain
Broadly, from China. As he did not intend to
touch at the Cape, I put a letter on board him for
the Secretary of the Admiralty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The account which we had heard of the Adventure
was now confirmed to us by this ship. We also
got, from on board her, a parcel of old newspapers,
which were new to us, and gave us some amusement;
but these were the least favours we received from
Captain Broadly. With a generosity peculiar to the
commanders of the India Company’s ships, he sent
us fresh provisions, tea, and other articles, which
were very acceptable; and deserve from me this public
acknowledgment. In the afternoon we parted
company. The True Briton stood out to sea, and
we in for the land; having a fresh gale at west, which
split our fore top-sail in such a manner, that we were
obliged to bring another to the yard. At six o’clock
we tacked within four or five miles of the shore; and,
as we judged, about five or six leagues to the east of
Cape Aguilas. We stood off till midnight, when,
the wind having veered round to the south, we tacked,
and stood along-shore to the west. The wind kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>veering more and more in our favour, and at last
fixed at E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., and blew, for some hours, a perfect
hurricane.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the storm began to subside we made
sail, and hauled in for the land. Next day at noon,
the Table Mountain over the Cape Town bore N.&nbsp;E.
by E., distant nine or ten leagues. By making use
of this bearing and distance to reduce the longitude
shewn by the watch to the Cape Town, the error was
found to be no more than 18ʹ in longitude, which it
was too far to the east. Indeed, the difference we
found between it and the lunar observations, since
we left New Zealand, had seldom exceeded half a
degree, and always the same way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning, being with us Wednesday, the
22d, but with the people here Tuesday, the 21st,
we anchored in Table Bay, where we found several
Dutch ships; some French; and the Ceres, Captain
Newte, an English East India Company’s ship, from
China, bound directly to England, by whom I sent
a copy of the preceding parts of this journal, some
charts, and other drawings, to the Admiralty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before we had well got to an anchor, I dispatched
an officer to acquaint the governor with our arrival,
and to request the necessary stores and refreshments,
which were readily granted. As soon as the officer
came back, we saluted the garrison with thirteen
guns, which compliment was immediately returned
with an equal number.</p>

<p class='c000'>I now learnt that the Adventure had called here,
on her return; and I found a letter from Captain
Furneaux, acquainting me with the loss of his boat,
and of ten of his best men, in Queen Charlotte’s
Sound. The captain, afterwards, on my arrival in
England, put into my hands a complete narrative of
his proceedings, from the time of our second and
final separation, which I now lay before the public in
the following chapter.</p>

VIII.<br /> <br />CAPTAIN FURNEAUX’S NARRATIVE OF HIS PROCEEDINGS, IN THE ADVENTURE, FROM THE TIME HE WAS SEPARATED FROM THE RESOLUTION, TO HIS ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND; INCLUDING LIEUTENANT BURNEY’S REPORT CONCERNING THE BOAT’S CREW, WHO WERE MURDERED BY THE INHABITANTS OF QUEEN CHARLOTTE’S SOUND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>After a passage of fourteen days from Amsterdam,
we made the coast of New Zealand near the Table
Cape, and stood along-shore till we came as far as
Cape Turnagain. The wind then began to blow
strong at west, with heavy squalls and rain, which
split many of our sails, and blew us off the coast for
three days; in which time we parted company with
the Resolution, and never saw her afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 4th of November, we again got in shore,
near Cape Palliser, and were visited by a number of
the natives in their canoes, bringing a great quantity
of cray-fish, which we bought of them for nails and
Otaheite cloth. The next day it blew hard from
W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W., which again drove us off the coast, and
obliged us to bring to for two days; during which
time it blew one continual gale of wind with heavy
falls of sleet. By this time our decks were very
leaky; our beds and bedding wet; and several of
our people complaining of colds; so that we began
to despair of ever getting into Charlotte Sound, or
joining the Resolution.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 6th, being to the north of the Cape, the
wind at S.&nbsp;W. and blowing strong, we bore away for
some bay to complete our water and wood, being in
great want of both; having been at the allowance of
one quart of water for some days past; and even
that pittance could not be come at, above six or seven
days longer. We anchored in Tolaga Bay on the
9th, in latitude 38° 21ʹ S., longitude 178° 37ʹ E.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>It affords good riding with the wind westerly, and
regular soundings from eleven to five fathoms, stiff
muddy ground across the bay for about two miles.
It is open from N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. to E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. It is to be observed,
easterly winds seldom blow hard on this shore,
but when they do, they throw in a great sea; so that
if it were not for a great undertow, together with a
large river that empties itself in the bottom of the
bay, a ship would not be able to ride here. Wood
and water are easily to be had, except when it blows
hard easterly. The natives here are the same as those
at Charlotte Sound, but more numerous, and seemed
settled, having regular plantations of sweet potatoes,
and other roots, which are very good; and they have
plenty of cray and other fish, which we bought of
them for nails, beads, and other trifles, at an easy
rate. In one of their canoes we observed the head
of a woman lying in state, adorned with feathers and
other ornaments. It had the appearance of being
alive; but, on examination, we found it dry, being
preserved with every feature perfect, and kept as the
relic of some deceased relation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having got about ten tons of water, and some
wood, we sailed for Charlotte Sound on the 12th.
We were no sooner out than the wind began to blow
hard, dead on the shore, so that we could not clear
the land on either tack. This obliged us to bear
away again for the bay, where we anchored the next
morning, and rode out a very heavy gale of wind at E.
by S. which threw in a very great sea. We now began
to fear we should never join the Resolution;
having reason to believe she was in Charlotte Sound,
and by this time ready for sea. We soon found it was
with great difficulty we could get any water, owing to
the swell setting in so strong; at last, however, we
were able to go on shore, and got both wood and
water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst we lay here, we were employed about the
rigging, which was much damaged by the constant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>gales of wind we had met with since we made the
coast. We got the booms down on the decks, and
having made the ship as snug as possible, sailed again
on the 16th. After this we met with several gales
of wind off the mouth of the Strait; and continued
beating backwards and forwards till the 30th, when
we were so fortunate as to get a favourable wind,
which we took every advantage of, and at last
got safe into our desired port. We saw nothing of
the Resolution, and began to doubt her safety; but
on going ashore, we discerned the place where she
had erected her tents; and, on an old stump of a
tree in the garden, observed these words cut out,
“Look underneath.” There we dug, and soon
found a bottle corked and waxed down, with a letter
in it from Captain Cook, signifying their arrival on
the 3d instant, and departure on the 24th; and that
they intended spending a few days in the entrance
of the Straits to look for us.</p>

<p class='c000'>We immediately set about getting the ship ready
for sea as fast as possible; erected our tents; sent
the cooper on shore to repair the casks; and began
to unstow the hold, to get at the bread that was in
butts; but on opening them found a great quantity
of it entirely spoiled, and most part so damaged that
we were obliged to fix our copper oven on shore to
bake it over again, which undoubtedly delayed us a
considerable time. Whilst we lay here, the inhabitants
came on board as before, supplying us with fish,
and other things of their own manufacture, which
we bought of them for nails, &amp;c. and appeared very
friendly; though twice in the middle of the night,
they came to the tent, with an intention to steal, but
were discovered before they could get any thing into
their possession.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 17th of December, having refitted the ship,
completed our water and wood, and got every thing
ready for sea, we sent our large cutter with Mr.
Rowe, a midshipman, and the boat’s crew, to gather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>wild greens for the ship’s company; with orders to
return that evening, as I intended to sail the next
morning. But, on the boat’s not returning the same
evening, nor the next morning, being under great
uneasiness about her, I hoisted out the launch, and
sent her, with the second lieutenant, Mr. Burney,
manned with the boat’s crew and ten marines, in
search of her. My orders to Mr. Burney were, first
to look well into East Bay, and then to proceed to
Grass Cove, the place to which Mr. Rowe had been
sent; and if he heard nothing of the boat there, to go
farther up the Sound, and come back along the west
shore. As Mr. Rowe had left the ship an hour before
the time proposed, and in a great hurry, I was
strongly persuaded that his curiosity had carried him
into East Bay, none in our ship having ever been
there; or else, that some accident had happened to
the boat, either by going a-drift through the boat-keeper’s
negligence, or by being stove among the
rocks. This was almost every body’s opinion; and
on this supposition the carpenter’s mate was sent in
the launch, with some sheets of tin. I had not the
least suspicion that our people had received any injury
from the natives; our boats having frequently
been higher up, and worse provided. How much I was
mistaken, too soon appeared; for Mr. Burney having
returned about eleven o’clock the same night, made
his report of a horrible scene indeed, which cannot
be better described than in his own words, which
now follow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the 18th we left the ship; and having a
light breeze in our favour, we soon got round Long
Island, and within Long Point. I examined every
cove, on the larboard hand, as we went along, looking
well all around with a spy-glass, which I took for
that purpose. At half-past one, we stopped at a
beach, on the left hand side going up East Bay, to
boil some victuals, as we brought nothing but raw
meat with us. Whilst we were cooking, I saw an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Indian on the opposite shore, running along a beach
to the head of the bay. Our meat being drest, we
got into the boat and put off; and, in a short time,
arrived at the head of this reach, where we saw an
Indian settlement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As we drew near, some of the Indians came
down on the rocks, and waved for us to be gone; but
seeing we disregarded them, they altered their notes.
Here we found six large canoes hauled up on the
beach, most of them double ones, and a great many
people; though not so many as one might expect
from the number of houses and size of the canoes.
Leaving the boat’s crew to guard the boat, I stepped
a-shore with the marines (the corporal and five men),
and searched a good many of their houses; but
found nothing to give me any suspicion. Three or
four well-beaten paths led farther into the woods,
where were many more houses; but the people continuing
friendly, I thought it unnecessary to continue
our search. Coming down to the beach, one of
the Indians had brought a bundle of <i>Hepatoos</i> (long
spears), but seeing I looked very earnestly at him,
he put them on the ground, and walked about with
seeming unconcern. Some of the people appearing
to be frightened, I gave a looking-glass to one, and
a large nail to another. From this place the bay ran,
as nearly as I could guess, N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. a good mile,
where it ended in a long sandy beach. I looked all
round with the glass, but saw no boat, canoe, or sign
of inhabitant. I therefore contented myself with
firing some guns, which I had done in every cove as
I went along.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I now kept close to the east shore, and came to
another settlement, where the Indians invited us
ashore. I inquired of them about the boat, but they
pretended ignorance. They appeared very friendly
here, and sold us some fish. Within an hour after
we left this place, in a small beach adjoining to Grass
Cove, we saw a very large double canoe just hauled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>up, with two men and a dog. The men, on seeing
us, left their canoe, and ran up into the woods. This
gave me reason to suspect I should here get tidings
of the cutter. We went ashore, and searched the
canoe, where we found one of the rullock-ports of
the cutter, and some shoes, one of which was known
to belong to Mr. Woodhouse, one of our midshipmen.
One of the people, at the same time, brought me a
piece of meat, which he took to be some of the salt
meat belonging to the cutter’s crew. On examining
this, and smelling to it, I found it was fresh. Mr.
Fannin (the master) who was with me, supposed it
was dog’s flesh, and I was of the same opinion; for
I still doubted their being cannibals. But we were
soon convinced by most horrid and undeniable proof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A great many baskets (about twenty) lying on
the beach tied up, we cut them open. Some were
full of roasted flesh, and some of fern-root, which
serves them for bread. On farther search, we found
more shoes and a hand, which we immediately knew
to have belonged to Thomas Hill, one of our forecastle
men, it being marked T. H. with an Otaheite
tattow-instrument. I went with some of the people
a little way up the woods, but saw nothing else.
Coming down again, there was a round spot covered
with fresh earth about four feet diameter, where
something had been buried. Having no spade, we
began to dig with a cutlass; and in the mean time I
launched the canoe with intent to destroy her; but
seeing a great smoke ascending over the nearest hill,
I got all the people into the boat, and made what
haste I could to be with them before sun-set.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On opening the next bay, which was Grass Cove,
we saw four canoes, one single and three double
ones, and a great many people on the beach, who, on
our approach, retreated to a small hill within a ship’s
length of the water-side, where they stood talking to
us. A large fire was on the top of the high land beyond
the woods, from whence, all the way down the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>hill the place was thronged like a fair. As we came
in, I ordered a musquetoon to be fired at one of the
canoes, suspecting they might be full of men lying
down in the bottom; for they were all afloat, but
nobody was seen in them. The savages on the little
hill still kept hallooing and making signs for us to
land. However, as soon as we got close in, we all
fired. The first volley did not seem to affect them
much; but on the second, they began to scramble
away as fast as they could, some of them howling.
We continued firing as long as we could see the
glimpse of any of them through the bushes. Amongst
the Indians were two very stout men, who never offered
to move till they found themselves forsaken by
their companions; and then they marched away with
great composure and deliberation; their pride not
suffering them to run. One of them however, got a
fall, and either lay there or crawled off on all fours.
The other got clear without any apparent hurt. I
then landed with the marines, and Mr. Fannin
stayed to guard the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the beach were two bundles of celery, which
had been gathered for loading the cutter. A broken
oar was stuck upright in the ground, to which the natives
had tied their canoes; a proof that the attack had
been made here. I then searched all along at the
back of the beach, to see if the cutter was there. We
found no boat, but instead of her, such a shocking
scene of carnage and barbarity as can never be mentioned
or thought of but with horror; for the heads,
hearts, and lungs of several of our people were seen
lying on the beach, and, at a little distance, the dogs
gnawing their entrails.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whilst we remained almost stupified on the spot,
Mr. Fannin called to us that he heard the savages
gathering together in the woods; on which I returned
to the boat, and hauling alongside the canoes, we demolished
three of them. Whilst this was transacting, the
fire on the top of the hill disappeared; and we could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>hear the Indians in the woods at high words, I suppose
quarrelling whether or no they should attack us,
and try to save their canoes. It now grew dark, I
therefore just stepped out, and looked once more
behind the beach to see if the cutter had been hauled
up in the bushes; but seeing nothing of her, returned
and put off. Our whole force would have been
barely sufficient to have gone up the hill, and to have
ventured with half (for half must have been left to
guard the boat) would have been fool-hardiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As we opened the upper part of the sound, we
saw a very large fire about three or four miles higher
up, which formed a complete oval, reaching from
the top of a hill down almost to the water-side, the
middle space being inclosed all round by the fire,
like a hedge. I consulted with Mr. Fannin, and we
were both of opinion that we could expect to reap
no other advantage than the poor satisfaction of killing
some more of the savages. At leaving Grass Cove,
we had fired a general volley towards where we heard
the Indians talking; but, by going in and out of the
boat, the arms had got wet, and four pieces missed
fire. What was still worse, it began to rain; our
ammunition was more than half expended, and we
left six large canoes behind us in one place. With so
many disadvantages, I did not think it worth while <a id='to'></a>to
proceed, where nothing could be hoped for but
revenge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Coming between two round islands, situated to
the southward of East Bay, we imagined we heard
somebody calling, we lay on our oars and listened, but
heard no more of it; we hallooed several times, but
to little purpose; the poor souls were far enough out
of hearing; and, indeed, I think it some comfort to
reflect that, in all probability, every man of them
must have been killed on the spot.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus far Mr. Burney’s report; and, to complete
the account of this tragical transaction, it may not be
unnecessary to mention that the people in the cutter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>were Mr. Rowe; Mr. Woodhouse; Francis Murphy,
quarter-master; William Facey, Thomas Hill, Michael
Bell, and Edward Jones, forecastle-men; John
Cavenaugh and Thomas Milton, belonging to the
after-guard; and James Sevilley, the captain’s man,
being ten in all. Most of these were of our very
best seamen, the stoutest and most healthy people in
the ship. Mr. Burney’s party brought on board two
hands, one belonging to Mr. Rowe, known by a hurt
he had received on it; the other to Thomas Hill, as
before-mentioned; and the head of the captain’s
servant. These, with more of the remains, were
tied in a hammock and thrown over-board, with ballast
and shot sufficient to sink it. None of their arms
nor clothes were found, except part of a pair of
trowsers, a frock, and six shoes, no two of them being
fellows.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am not inclined to think this was any premeditated
plan of these savages; for, the morning Mr.
Rowe left the ship, he met two canoes, which came
down and stayed all the forenoon in Ship Cove. It
might probably happen from some quarrel which was
decided on the spot; or the fairness of the opportunity
might tempt them, our people being so incautious,
and thinking themselves too secure. Another
thing which encouraged the New Zealanders, was,
they were sensible that a gun was not infallible, that
they sometimes missed, and that when discharged,
they must be loaded before they could be used again,
which time they knew how to take advantage of.
After their success, I imagine there was a general
meeting on the east side of the sound. The Indians
of Shag Cove were there; this we knew by a cock
which was in one of the canoes, and by a long single
canoe, which some of our people had seen four days
before in Shag Cove, where they had been with Mr.
Rowe in the cutter.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were detained in the sound by contrary winds
four days after this melancholy affair happened, during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>which time we saw none of the inhabitants. What
is very remarkable, I had been several times up in
the same cove with Captain Cook, and never saw the
least sign of an inhabitant, except some deserted
towns, which appeared as if they had not been occupied
for several years; and yet, when Mr. Burney
entered the cove, he was of opinion there could not
be less than fifteen hundred or two thousand people.
I doubt not, had they been apprized of his coming,
they would have attacked him. From these considerations
I thought it imprudent to send a boat up
again; as we were convinced there was not the least
probability of any of our people being alive.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 23d, we weighed and made sail out of the
Sound, and stood to the eastward to get clear of the
Straits; which we accomplished the same evening,
but were baffled for two or three days with light winds
before we could clear the coast. We then stood to the
S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E., till we got into the latitude of 56° S., without
any thing remarkable happening, having a great swell
from the southward. At this time the winds began to
blow strong from the S.&nbsp;W., and the weather to be very
cold; and as the ship was low and deep laden, the
sea made a continual breach over her, which kept us
always wet; and by her straining, very few of the
people were dry in bed or on deck, having no shelter
to keep the sea from them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The birds were the only companions we had in this
vast ocean; except now and then, we saw a whale or
porpoise, and sometimes a seal or two, and a few
penguins. In the latitude of 58° S., longitude 213°<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c009'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
E., we fell in with some ice, and every day saw more
or less, we then standing to the E. We found a very
strong current setting to the eastward; for by the
time we were abreast of Cape Horn, being in the
latitude of 61° S., the ship was a-head of our account
eight degrees. We were very little more than a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>month from Cape Palliser in New Zealand to Cape
Horn, which is an hundred and twenty-one degrees
of longitude, and had continual westerly winds from
S.&nbsp;W. to N.&nbsp;W., with a great sea following.</p>

<p class='c000'>On opening some casks of peas and flour, that
had been stowed on the coals, we found them very
much damaged, and not eatable; so thought it most
prudent to make for the Cape of Good Hope, but
first to stand into the latitude and longitude of Cape
Circumcision. After being to the eastward of Cape
Horn, we found the winds did not blow so strong
from the westward as usual, but came more from the
north, which brought on thick foggy weather; so
that for several days together we could not be able to
get an observation, or see the least sign of the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>This weather lasted above a month, being then
among a great many islands of ice, which kept us
constantly on the look-out for fear of running foul of
them, and, being a single ship, made us more attentive.
By this time our people began to complain of
colds and pains in their limbs, which obliged me to
haul to the northward to the latitude of 54° S., but
we still continued to have the same sort of weather,
though we had oftener an opportunity of obtaining
observations for the latitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>After getting into the latitude abovementioned,
I steered to the east, in order if possible to find
the land laid down by Bouvet. As we advanced
to the east, the islands of ice became more numerous
and dangerous; they being much smaller than they
used to be; and the nights began to be dark.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the third of March, being then in the latitude
of 54° 4ʹ S., longitude 13° E., which is the latitude of
Bouvet’s discovery, and half a degree to the eastward
of it, and not seeing the least sign of land, either
now or since we have been in this parallel, I gave
over looking for it, and hauled away to the northward.
As our last track to the southward was
within a few degrees of Bouvet’s discovery, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>longitude assigned to it, and about three or four degrees
to the southward, should there be any land
thereabout, it must be a very inconsiderable island.
But I believe it was nothing but ice; as we, in our first
setting out, thought we had seen land several times,
but it proved to be high islands of ice at the back of
the large fields; and as it was thick foggy weather
when Mr. Bouvet fell in with it, he might very easily
mistake them for land.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 7th, being in the latitude of 48° 30ʹ S.,
longitude 14° 26ʹ E., saw two large islands of ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 17th, made the land of the Cape of Good
Hope, and on the 19th anchored in Table Bay,
where we found Commodore Sir Edward Hughes,
with his Majesty’s ships Salisbury and Sea-horse.
<a id='salute'></a>I saluted the Commodore with thirteen guns; and
soon after, the garrison with the same number; the
former returned the salute, as usual, with two guns
less, and the latter with an equal number.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 24th, Sir Edward Hughes sailed with the
Salisbury and Sea-horse for the East Indies; but I
remained refitting the ship and refreshing my people
till the 16th of April, when I sailed for England and
on the 14th of July anchored at Spithead.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>I now resume my own Journal, which Captain Furneaux’s
interesting Narrative in the preceding chapter,
had obliged me to suspend.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day after my arrival at the Cape of Good Hope,
I went on shore and waited on the governor, Baron
Plettenberg, and other principal officers, who received
and treated us with the greatest politeness, contributing
all in their power to make it agreeable. And,
as there are few people more obliging to strangers
than the Dutch in general at this place, and refreshments
of all kinds are no where to be got in such
abundance, we enjoyed some real repose, after the
fatigues of a long voyage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The good treatment which strangers meet with at
the Cape of Good Hope, and the necessity of breathing
a little fresh air, has introduced a custom not
common any where else (at least I have no where
seen it so strictly observed), which is, for all the
officers who can be spared out of the ships to reside
on shore. We followed this custom. Myself, the
two Mr. Forsters, and Mr. Sparrman, took up our
abode with Mr. Brandt, a gentleman well known <a id='to2'></a>to
the English by his obliging readiness to serve
them. My first care after my arrival, was to procure
fresh-baked bread, fresh meat, greens, and wine, for
those who remained on board; and, being provided
every day during our stay with these articles, they
were soon restored to their usual strength. We had
only three men on board whom it was thought necessary
to send on shore for the recovery of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>health; and for these I procured quarters, at the
rate of thirty stivers, or half a crown, per day, for
which they were provided with victuals, drink, and
lodging.</p>

<p class='c000'>We now went to work to supply all our defects.
For this purpose, by permission, we erected a tent
on shore, to which we sent our casks and sails to be
repaired. We also struck the yards and topmasts,
in order to overhaul the rigging, which we found in
so bad a condition, that almost every thing, except
the standing rigging, was obliged to be replaced with
new; and that was purchased at a most exorbitant
price. In the article of naval stores, the Dutch here,
as well as at Batavia, take a shameful advantage of
the distress of foreigners.</p>

<p class='c000'>That our rigging, sails, &amp;c. should be worn out,
will not be wondered at, when it is known, that, during
this circumnavigation of the globe, that is, from
our leaving this place, to our return to it again, we
had sailed no less than twenty thousand leagues; an
extent of voyage, nearly equal to three times the equatorial
circumference of the earth, and which, I apprehend,
was never sailed by any ship in the same space of
time before. And yet, in all this great run, which
had been made in all latitudes between 9° and 71°,
we sprung neither low-masts, top-mast, lower nor
top-sail yard, nor so much as broke a lower or top-mast
shroud; which, with the great care and abilities
of my officers, must be owing to the good properties
of our ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the French ships which were at anchor
in the bay, was the Ajax Indiaman, bound to
Pondicherry, commanded by Captain Crozet. He
had been second in command with Captain Morion,
who sailed from this place with two ships, in March,
1772, as hath been already mentioned. Instead of
going from hence to America, as was said, he stood
away for New Zealand; where, in the Bay of Isles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>he and some of his people were killed by the inhabitants.
Captain Crozet, who succeeded to the command,
returned by the way of the Philippine Isles,
with the two ships, to the Island of Mauritius. He
seemed to be a man possessed of the true spirit of
discovery, and to have abilities. In a very obliging
manner, he communicated to me a chart, wherein
were delineated not only his own discoveries, but also
that of Captain Kerguelen, which I found laid down
in the very situation where we searched for it; so
that I can, by no means, conceive how both we and
the Adventure missed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Resides this land, which Captain Crozet told us
was a long but very narrow island, extending east
and west, Captain Morion, in about the latitude
of 48° S., and from 16° to 30° of longitude east of
the Cape of Good Hope, discovered six islands which
were high and barren. These, together with some
islands lying between the line and the southern tropic
in the Pacific Ocean, were the principal discoveries
made in this voyage, the account of which, we were
told, was ready for publication.</p>

<p class='c000'>By Captain Crozet’s chart it appeared that a voyage
had been made by the French across the South Pacific
Ocean, in 1769, under the command of one Captain
Surville; who, on condition of his attempting discoveries,
had obtained leave to make a trading voyage
to the coast of Peru. He fitted out, and took in a
cargo, in some part of the East Indies; proceeded by
way of the Philippine Isles; passed near New
Britain; and discovered some land in the latitude
of 10° S., longitude 158° E. to which he gave his
own name. From hence he steered to the south;
passed but a few degrees to the west of New Caledonia;
fell in with New Zealand at its northern extremity,
and put into Doubtful Bay, where it seems,
he was, when I passed it, on my former voyage, in
the Endeavour. From New Zealand, Captain Surville
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>steered to the east, between the latitude of 35°
and 41° south, until he arrived on the coast of America;
where, in the port of Callao, in attempting to
land, he was drowned.</p>

<p class='c000'>These voyages of the French, though undertaken
by private adventurers, have contributed something
towards exploring the Southern Ocean. That of Captain
Surville, clears up a mistake, which I was led into,
in imagining the shoals off the west end of New Caledonia
to extend to the west, as far as New Holland.
It proves that there is an open sea in that space, and
that we saw the N.&nbsp;W. extremity of that country.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the same gentleman we learnt, that the ship
which had been at Otaheite before our first arrival
there this voyage, was from New Spain; and that,
in her return, she had discovered some islands in the
latitude of 32° S. and under the meridian of 130° W.
Some other islands, said to be discovered by the
Spaniards, appeared on this chart; but Captain Crozet
seemed to think, they were inserted from no good
authorities.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were likewise informed of a later voyage undertaken
by the French, under the command of
Captain Kerguelen, which had ended much to the
disgrace of that commander.</p>

<p class='c000'>While we lay in Table Bay, several foreign ships
put in and out, bound to and from India, viz. English,
French, Danes, Swedes, and three Spanish frigates,
two of them going to, and one coming from, Manilla.
It is but very lately that the Spanish ships have
touched here; and these were the first that were allowed
the same privileges as other European friendly
nations.</p>

<p class='c000'>On examining our rudder, the pintles were found
to be loose, and we were obliged to unhang it, and
take it on shore to repair. We were also delayed
for want of calkers to calk the ship, which was absolutely
necessary to be done, before we put to sea.
At length I obtained two workmen from one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Dutch ships; and the Dutton English East Indiaman,
coming in from Bengal, Captain Rice, obliged
me with two more; so that by the 26th of April,
this work was finished; and having got on board all
necessary stores, and a fresh supply of provisions
and water, we took leave of the governor and other
principal officers, and the next morning repaired on
board. Soon after, the wind coming fair, we weighed
and put to sea; as did also the Spanish frigate Juno,
from Manilla, a Danish Indiaman, and the Dutton.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as we were under sail, we saluted the garrison
with thirteen guns; which compliment was immediately
returned with the same number. The Spanish
frigate and Danish Indiaman, both saluted us as we
passed them, and I returned each salute with an
equal number of guns. When we were clear of the
bay, the Danish ship steered for the East Indies,
the Spanish frigate for Europe, and we and the
Dutton for St. Helena.</p>

<p class='c000'>Depending on the goodness of Mr. Kendall’s watch,
I resolved to try to make the island, by a direct
course. For the first six days, that is, till we got into
the latitude of 27° S., longitude
<span class='nobreak'>11<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>°</span>
W. of the
Cape, the winds were southerly and S.&nbsp;E. After
this we had variable light airs for two days; they
were succeeded by a wind at S.&nbsp;E. which continued
to the island, except a part of one day, when it was
at N.&nbsp;E. In general, the wind blew faint all the passage,
which made it longer than common.</p>

<p class='c000'>At day-break, in the morning of the 15th of May,
we saw the island of St. Helena, at the distance of
fourteen leagues; and, at midnight, anchored in the
road before the town, on the N.&nbsp;W. side of the island.
At sunrise the next morning, the castle, and also the
Dutton, saluted us, each with thirteen guns; on my
landing, soon after, I was saluted by the castle, with
the same number; and each of the salutes was returned
by the ship.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Governor Skettowe, and the principal gentlemen
of the island, received and treated me, during my
stay, with the greatest politeness, by showing me
every kind of civility in their power.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whoever views St. Helena, in its present state, and
can but conceive what it must have been originally,
will not hastily charge the inhabitants with want of
industry. Though, perhaps, they might apply it to
more advantage, were more land appropriated to
planting of corn, vegetables, roots, &amp;c. instead of
being laid out in pasture, which is the present mode.
But this is not likely to happen, so long as the greatest
part of it remains in the hands of the Company
and their servants. Without industrious planters
this island can never flourish, and be in a condition
to supply the shipping with the necessary refreshments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within these three years a new church has been
built; some other new buildings were in hand;
a commodious landing-place for boats has been
made; and several other improvements, which add
both strength and beauty to the place.</p>

<p class='c000'>During our stay here we finished some necessary
repairs of the ship, which we had not time to do at
the Cape. We also filled all our empty water casks;
and the crew were served with fresh beef, purchased
at fivepence per pound. Their beef is exceedingly
good, and is the only refreshment to be had worth
mentioning.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a series of observations made at the Cape Town,
and at James Fort, in St. Helena; at the former by
Messrs. Mason and Dixon, and at the latter by
Mr. Maskelyne, the present astronomer royal, the
difference of longitude between these two places is
24° 12ʹ 15ʺ, only two miles more than Mr. Kendall’s
watch made. The lunar observations made by Mr.
Wales, before we arrived at the island, and after we
left it, and reduced to it by the watch, gave 5° 51ʹ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>for the longitude of James Fort; which is only five
miles more west, than it is placed by Mr. Maskelyne.
In like manner, the longitude of the Cape Town
was found within 5ʹ of the truth. I mention this, to
show how near the longitude of places may be found
by the lunar method, even at sea, with the assistance
of a good watch.</p>

  <h2 id='b4c10' class='c004'>CHAP. X.<br /> <br />PASSAGE FROM ST. HELENA TO THE WESTERN ISLANDS, WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISLAND OF ASCENSION AND FERNANDO NORONHO.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>On the 21st, in the evening, I took leave of the
governor, and repaired on board. Upon my leaving
the shore, I was saluted with thirteen guns; and, upon
my getting under sail, with the Dutton in company,
I was saluted with thirteen more; both of which I
returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>After leaving St. Helena, the Dutton was ordered
to steer N.&nbsp;W. by W. or N.&nbsp;W. by compass, in order
to avoid falling in with Ascension; at which island,
it was said, an illicit trade was carried on between
the officers of the India Company’s ships, and some
vessels from North America, who, of late years, had
frequented the island, on pretence of fishing for
whales, or catching turtle, when their real design
was to wait the coming of the India ships. In order
to prevent their homeward bound ship from falling
in with these smugglers, and to put a stop to this illicit
trade, the Dutton was ordered to steer the course
above-mentioned till to the northward of Ascension.
I kept company with this ship till the 24th, when,
after putting a packet on board her for the Admiralty,
we parted; she continuing her course to the N.&nbsp;W.
and I steering for Ascension.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the morning of the 28th, I made the island, and
the same evening anchored in Cross Bay on the
N.&nbsp;W. side, in ten fathoms’ water, the bottom a fine
sand, and half a mile from the shore. The Cross
Hill, so called on account of a cross, or flag-staff
erected upon it, bore by compass S. 38° E.; and
the two extreme points of the Bay extended from
N.&nbsp;E. to S.&nbsp;W. We remained here till the evening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>of the 31st; and, notwithstanding we had several parties
out every night, we got but twenty-four turtle,
it being rather too late in the season; however, as
they weighed between four or five hundred pounds
each, we thought ourselves not ill off. We might
have had a plentiful supply of fish in general; especially
of that sort called old wives, I have no where
seen such abundance; there were also cavalies, congor
eels, and various other sorts; but the catching of
any of these was not attended to, the object being
turtle. There are abundance of goats, and aquatic
birds, such as men-of-war and tropic birds, boobies,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>The island of Ascension is about ten miles in
length, in the direction of N.&nbsp;W. and S.&nbsp;E. and about
five or six in breadth. It shews a surface composed
of barren hills and valleys, on the most of which not
a shrub or plant is to be seen for several miles, and
where we found nothing but stones and sand, or rather
slags and ashes; an indubitable sign that the isle,
at some remote time, has been destroyed by a volcano,
which has thrown up vast heaps of stones, and
even hills. Between these heaps of stones we found
a smooth even surface, composed of ashes and sand,
and very good travelling upon it; but one may as
easily walk over broken glass bottles as over the
stones. If the foot deceives you, you are sure to be
cut or lamed, which happened to some of our people.
A high mountain, at the S.&nbsp;E. end of the isle, seems
to be left in its original state, and to have escaped
the general destruction. Its soil is a kind of white
marl, which yet retains its vegetative qualities, and
produceth a kind of purslain, spurg, and one or two
grasses. On these the goats subsist; and it is at this
part of the isle where they are to be found, as also
land-crabs, which are said to be very good.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was told, that about this part of the isle is some
very good land, on which might be raised many necessary
articles; and some have been at the trouble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>of sowing turnips and other useful vegetables. I was
also told there is a fine spring in a valley which disjoins
two hills on the top of the mountain above mentioned;
besides great quantities of fresh water in
holes in the rocks, which the person who gave me
this information believed was collected from rains.
But these supplies of water can only be of use to the
traveller; or to those who may be so unfortunate as
to be shipwrecked on the island; which seems to
have been the fate of some not long ago, as appeared
by the remains of a wreck we found on the N.&nbsp;E. side.
By what we could judge, she seemed to have been a
vessel of about one hundred and fifty tons burthen.</p>

<p class='c000'>While we lay in the road, a sloop of about seventy
tons burthen came to an anchor by us. She belonged
to New York, which place she left in February; and
having been to the coast of Guinea with a cargo of
goods, was come here to take in turtle to carry to
Barbadoes. This was the story which the master,
whose name was Greves, was pleased to tell, and
which may, in part, be true. But I believe the chief
view of his coming here, was the expectation of
meeting with some of the India ships. He had been
in the island near a week, and had got on board
twenty turtle. A sloop, belonging to Bermuda, had
sailed but a few days before with one hundred and
five on board, which was as many as she could take
in; but having turned several more on the different
sandy beaches, they had ripped open their bellies,
taken out the eggs, and left the carcasses to putrify;
an act as inhuman as injurious to those who came
after them. Part of the account I have given of the
interior parts of this island I received from Captain
Greves, who seemed to be a sensible intelligent man,
and had been all over it. He sailed in the morning
of the same day we did.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turtle, I am told, are to be found at this isle from
January to June. The method of catching them is
to have people upon the several sandy bays, to watch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>their coming on shore to lay their eggs, which is always
in the night, and then to turn them on their
backs, till there be an opportunity to take them off
the next day. It was recommended to us to send a
good many men to each beach, where they were to
lie quiet till the turtle were ashore, and then rise and
turn them at once. This method may be the best
when the turtle are numerous; but when there are
but few, three or four men are sufficient for the largest
beach; and if they keep patroling it, close to the
wash of the surf, during the night, by this method
they will see all that come ashore, and cause less noise
than if there were more of them. It was by this
method we caught the most we got; and this is the
method by which the Americans take them. Nothing
is more certain than that all the turtle which are
found about this island, come here for the sole purpose
of laying their eggs; for we meet with none
but females; and of all those which we caught, not
one had any food worth mentioning in its stomach;
a sure sign, in my opinion, that they must have been
a long time without any; and this may be the reason
why the flesh of them is not so good as some I have
ate on the coast of New South Wales, which were
caught on the spot where they fed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The watch made 8° 45ʹ difference of longitude
between St. Helena and Ascension; which added to
5° 49ʹ, the longitude of James Fort in St. Helena,
gives 14° 34ʹ for the longitude of the Road of Ascension,
or 14° 30ʹ for the middle of the island, the latitude
of which is 8° S. The lunar observations made
by Mr. Wales, and reduced to the same point of the
island by the watch, gave 14° 28ʹ 30ʺ west longitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 31st of May we left Ascension, and steered
to the northward, with a fine gale at S.&nbsp;E. by E. I
had a great desire to visit the island of St. Matthew,
to settle its situation; but as I found the winds would
not let me fetch it, I steered for the island of Fernando
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>de Noronho, on the coast of Brazil, in order
to determine its longitude, as I could not find this
had yet been done. Perhaps I should have performed
a more acceptable service to navigation, if I had
gone in search of the island of St. Paul, and those
shoals which are said to lie near the equator, and
about the meridian of 20° west; as neither their
situation nor existence are well known. The truth
is, I was unwilling to prolong the passage in searching
for what I was not sure to find; nor was I willing
to give up every object, which might tend to the
improvement of navigation or geography, for the
sake of getting home a week or a fortnight sooner.
It is but seldom that opportunities of this kind offer;
and when they do, they are too often neglected.</p>

<p class='c000'>In our passage to Fernando de Noronho, we had
steady fresh gales between the S.&nbsp;E. and E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. attended
with fair and clear weather; and as we had
the advantage of the moon, a day or night did not
pass without making lunar observations for the determining
our longitude. In this run, the variation
of the compass gradually decreased from 11° west,
which it was at Ascension, to 1° west, which we
found off Fernando de Noronho. This was the mean
result of two compasses, one of which gave 1° 37ʹ,
and the other 23ʹ west.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 9th of June, at noon, we made the island
of Fernando de Noronho, bearing S.&nbsp;W. by W.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
W.,
distant six or seven leagues, as we afterwards found
by the log. It appeared in detached and peaked hills,
the largest of which looked like a church tower or
steeple. As we drew near the S.&nbsp;E. part of the isle,
we perceived several unconnected sunken rocks lying
near a league from the shore, on which the sea broke
in a great surf. After standing very near these rocks,
we hoisted our colours, and then bore up round the
north end of the isle, or rather round a group of little
islets; for we could see that the land was divided by
narrow channels. There is a strong fort on the one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>next the main island, where there are several others;
all of which seemed to have every advantage that nature
can give them, and they are so disposed as
wholly to command all the anchoring and landing-places
about the island. We continued to steer round
the northern point, till the sandy beaches (before
which is the road for shipping) began to appear, and
the forts and the peaked hills were open to the westward
of the said point. At this time, on a gun being
fired from one of the forts, the Portuguese colours
were displayed, and the example was followed by all
the other forts. As the purpose for which I made
the island was now answered, I had no intention to
anchor; and therefore, after firing a gun to leeward,
we made sail and stood away to the northward, with a
fine fresh gale at E.&nbsp;S. E. The peaked hill or church
tower bore south, 27° west, distant about four or
five miles; and from this point of view it leans, or
over-hangs, to the east. This hill is nearly in the
middle of the island, which no where exceeds two
leagues in extent, and shows a hilly unequal surface,
mostly covered with wood and herbage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ulloa says, “This island hath two harbours, capable
of receiving ships of the greatest burden; one
is on the north side, and the other on the N.&nbsp;W.
The former is, in every respect, the principal,
both for shelter and capacity, and the goodness of
its bottom; but both are exposed to the north and
west, though these winds, particularly the north,
are periodical, and of no long continuance.” He
further says, that you anchor in the north harbour
(which is no more than what I would call a road) in
thirteen fathoms’ water, one third of a league from
shore, bottom of fine sand; the peaked hill above
mentioned bearing S.&nbsp;W. 3° southerly.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c009'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This road seems to be well sheltered from the south
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>and east winds. One of my seamen had been on
board a Dutch India ship, who put in at this isle in
her way out, in 1770. They were very sickly, and
in want of refreshments and water. The Portuguese
supplied them with some buffaloes and fowls; and
they watered behind one of the beaches in a little
pool, which was hardly big enough to dip a bucket
in. By reducing the observed latitude at noon to the
peaked hill, its latitude will be 3° 53ʹ south; and its
longitude, by the watch, carried on from St. Helena,
is 32° 34ʹ west; and by observations of the sun and
moon, made before and after we made the isle, and
reduced to it by the watch, 32° 44ʹ 30ʺ west. This
was the mean result of my observations. The results
of those made by Mr. Wales, which were more numerous,
gave 32° 23ʹ. The mean of the two will be
pretty near the watch, and probably nearest the truth.
By knowing the longitude of this isle, we are able to
determine that of the adjacent east coast of Brazil;
which, according to the modern charts, lies about
sixty or seventy leagues more to the west. We might
very safely have trusted to these charts, especially
the Variation Chart for 1744, and Mr. Dalrymple’s
of the Southern Atlantic Ocean.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c009'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the 11th, at three o’clock in the afternoon, we
crossed the equator in the longitude of 32° 14ʹ west.
We had fresh gales at S.&nbsp;S. E., blowing in squalls, attended
by showers of rain, that continued at certain
intervals, till noon the next day, after which we had
twenty-four hours’ fair weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>At noon, on the 13th, being in the latitude of
3° 49ʹ north, longitude 31° 47ʹ west, the wind became
variable, between the N.&nbsp;E. and south; and we
had light airs and squalls by turns, attended by hard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>showers of rain, and for the most part dark gloomy
weather, which continued till the evening of the 15th,
when in the latitude of 5° 47ʹ north, longitude 31°
west, we had three calm days, in which time we did
not advance above ten or twelve leagues to the north.
We had fair weather and rain by turns; the sky, for
the most part, being obscured, and sometimes by
heavy dense clouds which broke in excessive hard
showers.</p>

<p class='c000'>At seven o’clock in the evening on the 18th, the
calm was succeeded by a breeze at east, which, the
next day, increasing and veering to and fixing at
N.&nbsp;E., we stretched to N.&nbsp;W. with our tacks on board.
We made no doubt that we had now got the N.&nbsp;E.
trade wind, <a id='as'></a>as it was attended with fair weather, except
now and then some light showers of rain; and,
as we advanced to the north, the wind increased and
blew a fresh top-gallant gale.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 21st, I ordered the still to be fitted to the
largest copper, which held about sixty-four gallons.
The fire was lighted at four o’clock in the morning,
and at six the still began to run. It was continued
till six o’clock in the evening; in which time we obtained
thirty-two gallons of fresh water, at the expence
of one bushel and a half of coals; which was
about three-fourths of a bushel more than was necessary
to have boiled the ship’s company’s victuals only;
but the expence of fuel was no object with me. The
victuals were dressed in the small copper, the other
being applied wholly to the still; and every method
was made use of to obtain from it the greatest quantity
of fresh water possible, as this was my sole motive
for setting it to work. The mercury in the thermometer
at noon was at eighty-four and a half, and
higher it is seldom found at sea. Had it been lower,
more water, under the same circumstances, would
undoubtedly have been produced; for the colder the
air is, the cooler you can keep the still, which will
condense the steam the faster. Upon the whole, this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>is an useful invention; but I would advise no man to
trust wholly to it. For although you may, provided
you have plenty of fuel and good coppers, obtain as
much water as will support life, you cannot, with all
your efforts, obtain sufficient to support health, in
hot climates especially, where it is the most wanting;
for I am well convinced, that nothing contributes
more to the health of seamen, than having
plenty of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind now remained invariably fixed at N.&nbsp;E.
and E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. and blew fresh with squalls, attended
with showers of rain, and the sky for the most part
cloudy. On the 25th, in the latitude of 16° 12ʹ
north, longitude 37° 20ʹ west, seeing a ship to windward
steering down upon us, we shortened sail in
order to speak with her; but finding she was Dutch
by her colours, we made sail again and left her to
pursue her course, which we supposed was to some
of the Dutch settlements in the West Indies. In the
latitude of 20° north, longitude 39° 45ʹ west, the
wind began to veer to E. by N. and E.; but the
weather remained the same; that is, we continued to
have it clear and cloudy by turns, with light squalls
and showers. Our track was between N.&nbsp;W. by N.
and N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. till noon on the 28th, after which our
course made good was N. by W., being at this time
in the latitude of 21° 21ʹ north, longitude 40° 6ʹ
west. Afterwards, the wind began to blow a little
more steady, and was attended with fair and clear
weather. At two o’clock in the morning of the 30th,
being in the latitude of 24° 20ʹ north, longitude 40°
47ʹ west, a ship, steering to the westward, passed us
within hale. We judged her to be English, as they
answered us in that language; but we could not understand
what they said, and they were presently out
of sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the latitude of 29° 30ʹ, longitude 41° 30ʹ, the
wind slackened and veered more to the S.&nbsp;E. We
now began to see some of that sea-plant, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>commonly called gulph-weed, from a supposition that
it comes from the Gulph of Florida. Indeed, for
aught I know to the contrary, it may be a fact; but
it seems not necessary, as it is certainly a plant which
vegetates at sea. We continued to see it, but always
in small pieces, till we reached the latitude 36°, longitude
39° west, beyond which situation no more
appeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 5th of July, in the latitude of 32° 31ʹ 30ʺ
north, longitude 40° 29ʹ west, the wind veered to
the east, and blew very faint; the next day it was
calm; the two following days we had variable light
airs and calms by turns; and, at length, on the 9th,
having fixed at S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W., it increased to a fresh gale,
with which we steered first N.&nbsp;E. and then E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E.
with a view of making some of the Azores, or Western
Isles. On the 11th, in the latitude of 36° 45ʹ
north, longitude 36° 45ʹ west, we saw a sail which
was steering to the west; and the next day we saw
three more.</p>

  <h2 id='b4c11' class='c011'>CHAP. XI.<br /> <br />ARRIVAL OF THE SHIP AT THE ISLAND OF FAYAL, A DESCRIPTION OF THE PLACE, AND THE RETURN OF THE RESOLUTION TO ENGLAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c008'>At five o’clock in the evening of the 13th, we made
the island of Fayal, one of the Azores, and soon after
that of Pico, under which we spent the night making
short boards. At day break, the next morning, we
bore away for the bay of Fayal, or De Horta, where,
at eight o’clock, we anchored in twenty fathoms
water, a clean sandy bottom, and something more
than half a mile from the shore. Here we moored
N.&nbsp;E. and S.&nbsp;W., being directed so to do by the master
of the port, who came on board before we dropped
anchor. When moored, the S.&nbsp;W. point of the bay
bore S. 16° W., and the N.&nbsp;E. point N. 33° E.; the
church at the N.&nbsp;E. end of the town N. 38° W.; the
west point of St. George’s Island N. 42° E., distant
eight leagues; and the Isle of Pico extending from
N. 74° E. to S. 46° E. distance four or five miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>We found in the bay, the Pourvoyeur, a large French
frigate, an American sloop, and a brig belonging to
the place. She had come last from the river Amazon,
where she took in a cargo of provisions for the Cape
Verde Islands; but, not being able to find them, she
steered for this place, <a id='where'></a>where she anchored about half
an hour before us.</p>

<p class='c000'>As my sole design in stopping here was to give
Mr. Wales an opportunity to find the rate of the
watch, the better to enable us to fix, with some degree
of certainty, the longitude of these islands, the
moment we anchored, I sent an officer to wait on the
English consul, and to notify our arrival to the Governor,
requesting his permission for Mr. Wales to
make observations on shore, for the purpose above-mentioned.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Mr. Dent, who acted as consul, in the
absence of Mr. Gathorne, not only procured this permission,
but accommodated Mr. Wales with a convenient
place in his garden, to set up his instruments;
so that he was enabled to observe equal altitudes the
same day.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were not more obliged to Mr. Dent for the very
friendly readiness he showed, in procuring us this and
every other thing we wanted, than for the very liberal
and hospitable entertainment we met with at his
house, which was open to accommodate us, both
night and day.</p>

<p class='c000'>During our stay, the ship’s company was served
with fresh beef; and we took on board about fifteen
tons of water, which we brought off in the country
boats, at the rate of about three shillings per ton.
Ships are allowed to water with their own boats, but
the many inconveniences attending it more than
overbalance the expense of hiring shore-boats which
is the most general custom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fresh provisions for present use may be got, such
as beef, vegetables, and fruit; and hogs, sheep, and
poultry, for sea-stock, at a pretty reasonable price;
but I do not know that any sea-provisions are to be
had, except wine. The bullocks and hogs are very
good, but the sheep are small, and wretchedly poor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal produce of Fayal is wheat and Indian
corn, with which they supply Pico, and some of the
other isles. The chief town is called Villa de Horta.
It is situated in the bottom of the bay, close to the
edge of the sea, and is defended by two castles, one
at each end of the town, and a wall of stone-work,
extending along the sea-shore, from the one to the
other. But these works are suffered to go to decay,
and serve more for show than strength. They heighten
the prospect of the city, which makes a fine appearance
from the road; but, if we except the Jesuits’
College, the monasteries and churches, there is not
another building that has any thing to recommend it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>either outside or in. There is not a glass window in
the place, except what are in the churches, and in a
country-house, which lately belonged to the English
consul; all the others being latticed, which, to an
Englishman, makes them look like prisons.</p>

<p class='c000'>This little city, like all others belonging to the Portuguese,
is crowded with religious buildings; there
being no less than three convents of men, and two
of women; and eight churches, including those belonging
to the convents, and the one in the Jesuits’
college. The college is a fine structure, and is seated
on an elevation in the pleasantest part of the city.
Since the expulsion of that order, it has been suffered
to go to decay, and will probably, in a few years, be
no better than a heap of ruins.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fayal, although the most noted for wine, does not
raise sufficient for its own consumption. This article
is raised on Pico, where there is no road for shipping;
but being brought to De Horta, and from thence
shipped abroad, chiefly to America, it has acquired
the name of Fayal wine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bay, or road of Fayal, is situated at the east
end of the isle, before the Villa de Horta, and facing
the west end of Pico. It is two miles broad, and
three quarters of a mile deep, and hath a semi-circular
form. The depth of water is from twenty to ten,
and even six fathoms, a sandy bottom; except near
the shore, and particularly near the S.&nbsp;W. head, off
which the bottom is rocky, also without the line,
which joins the two points of the bay, so that it is not
safe to anchor far out. The bearing before mentioned,
taken when at anchor, will direct any one to the best
ground. It is by no means a bad road, but the winds
most to be apprehended, are those which blow from
between the S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. and S.&nbsp;E.; the former is not so
dangerous as the latter, because, with it, you can always
get to sea. Besides this road, there is a small
cove round the S.&nbsp;W. point, called Porto Piere, in
which, I am told, a ship or two may lie in tolerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>safety, and where they sometimes heave small vessels
down.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Portuguese captain told me, that about half a
league from the road, in the direction of S.&nbsp;E.,
in a line between it and the south side of Pico,
lies a sunken rock, over which is twenty-two feet
water, and on which the sea breaks in hard gales
from the south. He also assured me, that of all the
shoals that are laid down in our charts and pilot-books
about these isles, not one has any existence
but the one between the islands of St. Michael
and St. Mary, called Hormingan.—This account
may be believed, without relying entirely upon
it. He further informed me, that it is forty-five
leagues from Fayal to the island of Flores; and
that there runs a strong tide between Fayal and Pico,
the flood setting to the N.&nbsp;E. and the ebb to the
S.&nbsp;W., but that out at sea, the direction is east and
west. Mr. Wales having observed the times of high
and low water, by the shore, concluded that it must
be high water at the full and change about twelve
o’clock, and the water riseth about four or five feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The distance between Fayal and Flores was confirmed
by Mr. Rebiers, lieutenant of the French frigate,
who told me, that, after being by estimation
two leagues due south of Flores, they made forty-four
leagues, on a S.&nbsp;E. by E., course by compass, to
St. Catherine’s Point, on Fayal.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found the variation of the compass, by several
azimuths, taken by different compasses on board the
ship, to agree very well with the like observations
made by Mr. Wales on shore; and yet the variation
thus found, is greater by 5°, than we found it to be
at sea; for the azimuths taken on board, the evening
before we came into the bay, gave no more than
16° 18ʹ west variation, and the evening after we
came out, 17° 33ʹ west.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall now give some account of the variation, as
observed in our run from the Island of Fernando
De Noronho, to Fayal. The least variation we found
was 37ʹ W., which was the day after we left Fernando
De Noronho, and in the latitude of 33ʹ S., longitude
32° 16ʹ W. The next day, being nearly in the same
longitude, and in the latitude of 1° 25ʹ N. it was
1° 23ʹ west; and we did not find it increase till we
got into the latitude of 5° N., longitude 31° west.
After this our compasses gave different variations, viz.
from 3° 57ʹ to 5° 11ʹ W. till we arrived in the latitude
of 26° 44ʹ north, longitude 41° west, when we
found 6° west. It then increased gradually, so that
in the latitude of 35° N. longitude 40° W., it was
10° 24ʹ W.; in the latitude of 38° 12ʹ N., longitude
<span class='nobreak'>32<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>°</span>
W., it was 14° 47ʹ; and in sight of Fayal 16° 18ʹ
W., as mentioned above.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having left the bay at four in the morning of the
19th, I steered for the west end of St. George’s Island.
As soon as we had passed it, I steered E.
<span class='nobreak'><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>
S.
for the Island of Tercera; and after having run thirteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>leagues, we were not more than one league from
the west end. I now edged away for the north side,
with a view of ranging the coast to the eastern point,
in order to ascertain the length of the island; but
the weather coming on very thick and hazy, and
night approaching, I gave up the design, and proceeded
with all expedition for England.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 29th, we made the land near Plymouth.
The next morning, we anchored at Spithead; and
the same day, I landed at Portsmouth, and set out for
London, in company with Messrs. Wales, Forsters,
and Hodges.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having been absent from England three years and
eighteen days, in which time, and under all changes
of climate, I lost but four men, and only one of them
by sickness, it may not be amiss, at the conclusion of
this journal, to enumerate the several causes to which,
under the care of Providence, I conceive, this uncommon
good state of health experienced by my people
was owing.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Introduction, mention has been made of
the extraordinary attention paid by the Admiralty, in
causing such articles to be put on board as, either
from experience or suggestion, it was judged would
tend to preserve the health of the seamen. I shall
not trespass upon the reader’s time in mentioning
them all, but confine myself to such as were found
the most useful.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were furnished with a quantity of malt, of
which was made <i>Sweet Wort</i>. To such of the men as
showed the least symptoms of the scurvy; and also
to such as were thought to be threatened with that
disorder, this was given from one to two or three
pints a day each man; or in such proportion as the
surgeon found necessary, which sometimes amounted
to three quarts. This is, without doubt, one of the best
antiscorbutic sea medicines yet discovered: and, if
used in time, will, with proper attention to other things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>I am persuaded, prevent the scurvy from making
any great progress for a considerable while. But
I am not altogether of opinion that it will cure it
at sea.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Sour Krout</i>, of which we had a large quantity, is
not only a wholesome vegetable food, but, in my
judgment, highly antiscorbutic; and it spoils not by
keeping. A pound of this was served to each man
when at sea, twice a week or oftener, as was thought
necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Portable Broth</i> was another great article, of which
we had a large supply. An ounce of this to each
man, or such other proportion as circumstances
pointed out, was boiled in their pease, three days in
the week; and when we were in places where vegetables
were to be got, it was boiled with them, and
wheat or oatmeal, every morning for breakfast; and
also with pease and vegetables for dinner. It enabled
us to make several nourishing and wholesome messes,
and was the means of making the people eat a greater
quantity of vegetables than they would otherwise have
done.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Rob of Lemon</i> and <i>Orange</i> is an antiscorbutic we
were not without. The surgeon made use of it in
many cases, with great success.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amongst the articles of victualling, we were supplied
with <i>Sugar</i> in the room of <i>Oil</i>, and with <i>Wheat</i>
for a part of our <i>Oatmeal</i>; and were certainly gainers
by the exchange. Sugar, I apprehend, is a very
good antiscorbutic; whereas oil, (such as the navy is
usually supplied with,) I am of opinion, has the contrary
effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the introduction of the most salutary articles,
either as provisions or medicines, will generally prove
unsuccessful, unless supported by certain regulations.
On this principle, many years’ experience, together
with some hints I had from Sir Hugh Palliser, Captains
Campbell, Wallis, and other intelligent officers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>enabled me to lay a plan whereby all was to be
governed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crew were at three watches, except upon some
extraordinary occasions. By this means they were
not so much exposed to the weather as if they had
been at watch and watch; and had generally dry
cloaths to shift themselves, when they happened to
get wet. Care was also taken to expose them as little
to wet weather as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Proper methods were used to keep their persons,
hammocks, bedding, cloaths, &amp;c. constantly clean
and dry. Equal care was taken to keep the ship
clean and dry betwixt decks. Once or twice a week
she was aired with fires; and when this could not be
done, she was smoked with gunpowder mixed with
vinegar or water. I had also frequently a fire made
in an iron pot at the bottom of the well, which was of
great use in purifying the air in the lower parts of the
ship. To this and to cleanliness, as well in the ship
as amongst the people, too great attention cannot
be paid; the least neglect occasions a putrid and
disagreeable smell below, which nothing but fires will
remove.</p>

<p class='c000'>Proper attention was paid to the ship’s coppers, so
that they were kept constantly clean.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fat which boiled out of the salt beef and pork,
I never suffered to be given to the people; being of
opinion that it promotes the scurvy.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was careful to take in water wherever it was to
be got, even though we did not want it. Because I
look upon fresh water from the shore, to be more
wholesome than that which has been kept some time
on board a ship. Of this essential article, we were
never at an allowance, but had always plenty for
every necessary purpose. Navigators in general cannot,
indeed, expect, nor would they wish to meet
with, such advantages in this respect, as fell to my
lot. The nature of our voyage carried us into very
high latitudes. But the hardships and dangers inseparable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>from that situation, were, in some degree,
compensated by the singular felicity we enjoyed, of
extracting inexhaustible supplies of fresh water from
an ocean strewed with ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>We came to few places, where either the art of
man, or the bounty of nature, had not provided
some sort of refreshment or other, either in the
animal or vegetable way. It was my first care to
procure whatever of any kind could be met with, by
every means in my power; and to oblige our people
to make use thereof, both by my example and authority;
but the benefits arising from refreshments of
any kind soon became so obvious, that I had little
occasion to recommend the one or to exert the
other.</p>

<p class='c000'>It doth not become me to say how far the principal
objects of our voyage have been obtained. Though it
hath not abounded with remarkable events, nor been
diversified by sudden transitions of fortune; though
my relation of it has been more employed in tracing
our course by sea, than in recording our operations
on shore; this, perhaps, is a circumstance from which
the curious reader may infer, that the purposes for
which we were sent into the southern hemisphere
were diligently and effectually pursued. Had we
found out a continent there, we might have been
better enabled to gratify curiosity; but we hope
our not having found it, after all our persevering
searches, will leave less room for future speculation
about unknown worlds remaining to be
explored.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, whatever may be the public judgment about
other matters, it is with real satisfaction, and without
claiming any merit but that of attention to my
duty, that I can conclude this account with an observation
which facts enable me to make, that our
having discovered the possibility of preserving health
amongst a numerous ship’s company, for such a
length of time, in such varieties of climate, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>amidst such continued hardships and fatigues, will
make this voyage remarkable in the opinion of
every benevolent person, when the disputes about
a Southern Continent shall have ceased to engage
the attention, and to divide the judgment of philosophers.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0 c013'>As all nations who are acquainted with the method
of communicating their ideas by characters
(which represent the sound that conveys the idea),
have some particular method of managing or pronouncing
the sounds represented by such characters,
this forms a very essential article in the constitution
of the language of any particular nation,
and must therefore be understood before we can
make any progress in learning, or be able to converse
in it. But as this is very complex and tedious
to a beginner, by reason of the great variety of
powers the characters of letters are endued with
under different circumstances, it would seem necessary,
at least in languages which have never before
appeared in writing, to lessen the number of
these varieties, by restraining the different sounds,
and always representing the same simple ones by the
same character; and this is no less necessary in the
English than any other language, as this variety of
powers is very frequent, and without being taken
notice of in the following Vocabulary, might render
it entirely unintelligible. As the vowels are the
regulation of all sounds, it is these only that need
be noticed, and the powers allotted to each of these
in the Vocabulary is subjoined.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>A</i> in the English language is used to represent two
different simple sounds, as in the word Arabia,
where the first and last have a different power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>from the second. In the Vocabulary this letter
must always have the power, or be pronounced
like the first and last in Arabia. The other power
or sound of the second <i>a</i>, is always represented in
the Vocabulary by <i>a</i> and <i>i</i>, printed in Italics
thus, <i>ai</i>.</p>
<p class='c010'><i>E</i> has likewise two powers, or it is used to represent
two simple sounds, as in the words Eloquence,
Bred, Led, &amp;c. and it may be said to have a third
power, as in the words Then, When, &amp;c. In the
first case, this letter is only used at the beginning
of words, and wherever it is met with in any other
place in the words of the Vocabulary, it is used as
in the second case: but never as in the third example;
for this power or sound is every where
expressed by the <i>a</i> and <i>i</i> before mentioned, printed
in Italics.</p>
<p class='c010'><i>I</i> is used to express different simple sounds, as in
the words Indolence, Iron, and Imitation. In the
Vocabulary it is never used as in the first case,
but in the middle of words; it is never used as in
the second example, for that sound is always
represented by <i>y</i>, nor is it used as in the last
case, that sound being always represented by two
<i>ee</i>s, printed in Italics in this manner, <i>ee</i>.</p>
<p class='c010'><i>O</i> never alters in the pronunciation, <i>i. e.</i> in this
Vocabulary, of a simple sound, but is often
used in this manner, <i>oo</i>, and sounds as in Good,
Stood, &amp;c.</p>
<p class='c010'><i>U</i> alters, or is used to express different simple sounds,
as in Unity, or Umbrage. Here the letters <i>e</i> and
<i>u</i>, printed in Italics <i>eu</i>, are used to express its
power as in the first example, and it always retains
the second power, wherever it is met with.</p>
<p class='c010'><i>Y</i> is used to express different sounds, as in My, By,
&amp;c. &amp;c. and in Daily, Fairly, &amp;c. Wherever it is
met with in the middle or end (<i>i. e.</i> any where but
at the beginning) of a word, it is to be used as in
the first example; but is never to be found as in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>the second, for that sound or power is always represented
by the Italic letter <i>e</i>. It has also a
third power, as in the words Yes, Yell, &amp;c.
which is retained every where in the Vocabulary,
at least at the beginning of words, or when it
goes before another vowel, unless directed to be
sounded separately by a mark over it, as thus,
ÿa.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unless in a few instances, these powers of the
vowels are used throughout the Vocabulary; but,
to make the pronunciation still less liable to change
or variation, a few marks are added to the words as
follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>This mark: as öa, means that these letters are
to be expressed singly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The letters in Italic, as <i>ee</i> or <i>oo</i>, make but one
simple sound.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a particular stress is laid on any part of a
word in the pronunciation, an accent is placed over
that letter where it begins, or rather between that
and the preceding one.</p>

<p class='c000'>It often happens that a word is compounded as it
were of two, or in some cases the same word or
syllable is repeated. In these circumstances, a
comma is placed under them at this division, where
a rest or small space of time is left before you proceed
to pronounce the other part, but it must not be
imagined that this is a full stop.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. See Don Antonio d’Ulloa’s Book, vol. ii. chap. 3. page 95
to 102, where there is a very particular account of this island.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. Ulloa says, that the chart places this island sixty leagues from
the coast of Brazil; and that the Portuguese pilots, who often
make the voyage, judge it to be eighty leagues; but, by taking the
mean between the two opinions, the distance may be fixed at seventy
leagues.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. It may be easily perceived, that notwithstanding some words are entirely different, the first five Indian languages are radically the same; though the distance from Easter Island to New Zealand
is upwards of fifteen hundred leagues. The principal difference consists in the mode of pronunciation, which in Easter Island, Amsterdam, and New Zealand, is more harsh, or guttural, than at the
Marquesas Isles, or Otaheite. The other three differ totally, not only from the preceding, but from each other; which is more extraordinary than the agreement of the others, as from Malicollo to
Tanna, you never lose sight of land, nor is New Caledonia at a great distance from the last place. In the language of Malicollo, a great number of harsh labial sounds prevail, very difficult to be
represented in writing. At Tanna the pronunciation is likewise harsh, but rather guttural, and the inhabitants of New Caledonia have many nasal sounds, or snivel much in speaking. It may,
however, be observed, that in the three last languages, some words are found, which seem to have a distant resemblance to those that go before; as Brr<i>oo</i>as in Malicollo, and ´B<i>oo</i>ga, or Boogas, in
Tanna, both signifying a hog, which at Otaheite, and the Marquesas, is expressed by the word ´Böa, and at Amsterdam by B<i>oo</i>´acka. Yet, whether these may not have been accidentally introduced,
is hard to determine; because they frequently use two words to express the same thing; as, for instance, in New Caledonia, they call a star both P<i>ee</i>j<i>oo</i> and Fy’fat<i>oo</i>: the first seems most
consonant to the general composition of their language, whereas the second differs very little from E’f<i>ai</i>t<i>oo</i> or Whett<i>oo</i>, the name of a star at Otaheite. When they mention puncturation, it is commonly
called Gan, Gan,galang; but sometimes they say Tata’tou, which is almost the same as Ta’t<i>ou</i>, used to express the same thing at Otaheite and Amsterdam.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. The letters in italic, as <i>oo</i>, <i>ee</i>, &amp;c. are to be sounded as one. Those with this ¨ as öe, &amp;c. separately. The accent at the beginning of a word, signifies the chief stress in pronunciation is to be
laid there: if over it, at any other part, the stress is laid on that part immediately following. A comma in the middle of a word, either signifies, that it is compounded of two; or, that the same
syllables repeated, make the word; in both which cases, a small stop, or pause, must be made in pronouncing it.</p>
